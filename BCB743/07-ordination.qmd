## Unconstrained ordination

We apply indirect gradient analysis when the gradients are unknown *a
priori* and we do not have environmental data related to the species.
Gradients or other influences that structure species in space are
therefore inferred from the species composition data only. The
communities thus tell us that gradients are present (or not), but it
might not offer insight into the identity of the structuring gradients.

## Constrained ordination

Any ordination approach in which important gradients are hypothesised.
Likely evidence for the existence of gradients is measured and captured
in a complementary environmental dataset that has the same spatial
structure (rows) as the species dataset. Direct gradient analysis is
performed using linear or non-linear regression approaches that relate
the ordinations performed on the species and their matching
environmental variables.
