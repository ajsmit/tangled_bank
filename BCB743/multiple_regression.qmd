## Tasks to complete in this chapter

* [Task G 1--5](assessments/Task_G.qmd) --- this is also the start of the Final Assessment.

When embarking in Task G, please refer to some musings in the chapter about [Model Building](model_building.qmd).

[The theory about multiple linear regression can be found in [Chapter 5](../docs/The-Biostatistics-Book-Ch-3-5.pdf).]{.my-highlight}


For this chapter, you will use the data analysed by @smit2017seaweeds, which you will have to read alongside [Deep Dive into Gradients](deep_dive.qmd) for the data description. Also refer to chapter [Seaweeds in Two Oceans: Beta-Diversity (Appendices)](Seaweed_in_Two_Oceans_v2/two_oceans_appendices.qmd).
