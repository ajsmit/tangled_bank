## Tasks to complete in this Chapter

* [Task D 1](assessments/Task_D.qmd)
:::

The United Nations adopted an agenda for sustainable development and lists 17 development goals to achieve by 2030. These are called the [Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)](https://sdgs.un.org/goals). The World Health Organization assembles a collection of indicators to track how countries are progressing towards these goals so as to achieve "a world free of poverty, hunger, disease and want" ([WHO](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/sustainable-development-goals)).

This is an ordination analysis of the SDG 3, "Good Health and Well-Being."

## Load packages

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(vegan)
library(missMDA) # to impute missing values
library(ggcorrplot) # for the correlations

# setting up a 'root' file path so I don't have to keep doing it later...
root <- "../data/WHO/"
```

## Define and load the data

**Note** The combined data and SDG descriptors are in the zip file. They are called `SDG_complete.csv` and `SDG_description.csv`, respectively. There is no need to work through the entire process below; you can simply start with loading the combined data. See the section *Scale and centre the data and do the PCA*, below.

```{r}
health_wide <- health_wide %>%
  mutate(SDG3.4_4 = SDG3.4_4 / popl_size * 100000,
         SDG3.4_3 = SDG3.4_3 / popl_size * 100000,
         SDG3.4_2 = SDG3.4_2 / popl_size * 100000,
         SDG3.4_6 = SDG3.4_6 / 100,
         SDG3.2_2 = SDG3.2_2 / popl_size * 100000,
         SDG3.2_3 = SDG3.2_3 / popl_size * 100000,
         SDG3.2_1 = SDG3.2_1 / popl_size * 100000)
```

## Histograms of missing values, and correlations

```{r}
# calculate histograms
health_wide$na_count <- apply(health_wide[, 3:(ncol(health_wide) - 1)], 1,
                              function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
hist(health_wide$na_count, breaks = 14, plot = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# remove rows where there are more than 10 NAs
health_wide <- health_wide %>%
  dplyr::filter(na_count <= 10) %>%
  dplyr::select(-na_count)
```

```{r}
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 8 
# calculate pairwise correlations
corr <- round(cor(health_wide[, 3:(ncol(health_wide) - 1)]), 1)

# visualization of the correlation matrix
ggcorrplot(corr, type = 'upper', outline.col = "grey60",
           colors = c("#1679a1", "white", "#f8766d"),
           lab = TRUE)
```

Some of the variables are multicollinear. See @graham2003confronting for a discussion of collieanrity in ecological data and how to deal with it.

## Impute remaining NAs

There are still many remaining NAs, and I impute them with the `imputePCA()` method in the **missMDA** package [see @dray2015principal].

```{r}
health_wide_complete <- imputePCA(health_wide[, 3:(ncol(health_wide) - 1)])$completeObs

# save for later use
# SGD_data <- cbind(health_wide[, 1:2], health_wide_complete)
# write_csv(SGD_data, file = paste0(root, "SDG_complete.csv"))
```

## Scale and center the data and do the PCA

**Note** The analysis can proceed from here from the `SDG_complete.csv` and `SDG_description.csv` files.

```{r}
health_wide_complete_std <- decostand(health_wide_complete,
                                      method = "standardize")
health_pca <- rda(health_wide_complete_std)
health_pca
# summary(health_pca)
```

## Graphical displays

Make figure using the **vegan** `biplot.rda()` function:

```{r}
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 6 
biplot(health_pca, scaling = 1, main = "PCA scaling 1", choices = c(1, 2))
biplot(health_pca, scaling = 2, main = "PCA scaling 2", choices = c(1, 2))
```

Assemble the ordination plot using the **vegan** component functions:

```{r}
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 6 
pl1 <- ordiplot(health_pca, type = "none", scaling = 1, main = "PCA WHO/SDG")
points(pl1, "sites", pch = 21, cex = 1.0, col = "grey20", bg = "grey80")
points(pl1, "species", pch = 21, col = "turquoise", arrows = TRUE)
text(pl1, "species", col = "blue4", cex = 0.9)
# text(pl1, "sites", col = "red4", cex = 0.9)

pl2 <- ordiplot(health_pca, type = "none", scaling = 2, main = "PCA WHO/SDG")
points(pl2, "sites", pch = 21, cex = 1.75, col = "grey80", bg = "grey80")
points(pl2, "species", pch = 21, col = "turquoise", arrows = TRUE)
text(pl2, "species", col = "blue4", cex = 0.9)
text(pl2, "sites", col = "red4", cex = 0.9)
```

Yet another way to make an ordination plot. Notice how I use `ggplot()` to assemble the figure from pre-assembled dataframes containing the species (SDGs) and site (countries) scores. In the respecitve dataframes I also include appropriate labels that can be used to colour-code the ParentLocation (major groupings of countries).

```{r}
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 6 
site_scores <- tibble(ParentLocation = health_wide$ParentLocation,
                      Location = health_wide$Location)
site_scores <- tibble(cbind(site_scores, scores(health_pca, display = "sites", choices = c(1:7))))
species_scores <- data.frame(scores(health_pca, display = "species", choices = c(1:7)))
species_scores$species <- rownames(species_scores)
species_scores <- tibble(species_scores)

ggplot(data = site_scores, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2)) +
  geom_point(aes(col = ParentLocation)) +
  geom_segment(data = species_scores, 
               aes(x = 0, y = 0, xend = PC1, yend = PC2),
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.4, "cm"), type = "closed"), 
               color = "lightseagreen", alpha = 1, size = 0.3) +
  geom_text(data = species_scores, 
            aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, label = species),
            color = "black") +
  xlab("PC1") + ylab("PC2") + 
  ggtitle("WHO SDGs, Scaling 2")
```

There seems to be separate groups of colours (ParentLocation). Certain countries come out together in this ordination. This analysis will benefit from a cluster analyses of some kind.
