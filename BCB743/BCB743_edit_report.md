## Inconsistencies, Ambiguities, and Clarity Recommendations
- “Shepard plot” is an accepted eponym in ordination; I left it unchanged despite spellchecker suggestions.
- URLs containing `adn.biol.umontreal.ca` are correct and were left unchanged.
- Oxford comma usage is now consistent in sentences edited here; consider a pass over remaining lists if you want strict consistency across the whole module.
- If you prefer avoiding contractions across the module (e.g., “it is” vs “it’s”), I can apply that consistently.
