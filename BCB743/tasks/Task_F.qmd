<!-- ## Submission instructions -->

<!-- Submit a Quarto HTML file wherein you provide answers to Questions 1--2 by the deadline in the syllabus schedule. -->

<!-- Provide a **neat and thoroughly annotated** Quarto/html files which outlines the graphs and all calculations and which displays the resultant distance matrix. Use separate tabs for the different questions. -->

<!-- Please label the Quarto and resulting HTML files as follows: -->

<!-- -   `BCB743_<first_name>_<last_name>_Task_F.qmd`, and -->

<!-- -   `BCB743_<first_name>_<last_name>_Task_F.html` -->

<!-- (the `<` and `>` must be omitted as they are used in the example as field indicators only). -->

<!-- Failing to follow these instructions carefully, precisely, and thoroughly will cause you to lose marks, which could cause a significant drop in your score as formatting counts for 15% of the final mark (out of 100%). -->

<!-- Submit your Labs on iKamva when ready. -->
