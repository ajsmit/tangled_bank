## Lecture Series Assignment: Harnessing Diverse Data for Ecological Insights Across Scales

We increasingly rely on a rich 'landscape' of data sources to untangle the complexities of ecosystems at local, regional, and global scales. This assessment task requires the class to critically examine the wide array of ecological data, their acquisition, integration, and the transformative role of technology in driving ecological research.

**Objective**: Develop a comprehensive understanding of the diverse data sources available to ecologists, their strengths, and limitations, and how to harness them effectively to address research questions across scales.

**Approach**: You will prepare a set of lectures that will explore the landscape of ecological data, from open data repositories to field campaign datasets, and discuss the methodologies for integrating, and analysing these diverse sources. The role of technology in advancing ecological research and the principles of open science will also be highlighted.

**Due Date**: From 13 June 2025

### Lecture series structure

Create a lecture set comprised of a textbook (approx. 40-50 pages in Quarto, MS Word format, but presented as HTML), and Quarto slides that addresses the following key areas:

#### Topic 1: A history of quantitative ecology

   - In this lecture topic, I want you to discuss the origin of what has today become the field of quantitative ecology. You should go back to when someone first studied ecosystems, or communities — in other words, the full complement of species within combined multiple populations occupying landscapes --, and asked questions about what structures these communities across space and time. See if you can highlight some of the earliest studies that employed techniques involving the analysis of multiple species, and then track the progression of the field over time, highlighting key developments that have taken place. What is seen as state-of-the-art today? What are some of the most important discoveries made about how ecosystems work?

#### Topic 2: challenges of studying multiple species

   - In this lecture topic, I would like you to talk about the various challenges that quantitative ecologists face. These could include challenges around how people go about acquiring the data they need — such as data about species, and the environmental conditions across the landscapes occupied by those species — all the way through to the analysis of the data they collect.

#### Topic 3: case studies

   - Please focus on two important and interesting case studies involving the analysis of quantitative ecological data. Discuss the methodologies employed in conducting these studies, outline the aims, objectives, and findings, and address the implications of these studies. Why are these studies interesting, and why did you decide to include them here? When you research these case studies, ensure they have been published in well-known journals, and are supported by public data repositories. We may use these data in our lecture series to test, explain, and demonstrate various quantitative ecological methods, such as ordinations, and cluster analyses.

#### Topic 4: data integration methodologies

   - Describe the challenges and opportunities associated with integrating disparate data sources. Explain the importance of data standardisation, cleaning, harmonisation, and alignment in time, and space.
   - Discuss various data integration methods, such as data fusion, data assimilation, and meta-analysis. Explain how these methods enhance ecological research by combining information from multiple sources.

#### Topic 5: case studies across scales

   - Choose *three* specific case studies or research scenarios that exemplify the use of open data and field campaign data to address ecological questions across different spatial and temporal scales.
   - For each case study:
      - Briefly describe the research question and ecological context.
      - Identify the specific data sources used (both open and field campaign).
      - Explain how the data was integrated and analysed.
      - Summarise the key findings and their broader ecological implications.

#### Topic 6: the role of technology

   - Explore the advancements in data analytics, machine learning, and computational modelling that have revolutionised the way ecologists access, analyse, and integrate data.
   - Discuss how these technologies facilitate the extraction of patterns, identification of drivers, and forecasting of ecological dynamics.
   - Provide examples of how technology has enabled ecological research that was previously not feasible (e.g., large-scale species distribution modelling, ecosystem service assessments).

#### Topic 7: open science and FAIR principles

   - Explain the principles of open science, with a focus on open data, and the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).
   - Discuss how open science fosters collaboration, accelerates scientific discovery, and enhances the reproducibility of ecological research.
   - Critically reflect on the potential of open science to democratize access to ecological data and empower researchers in under-resourced regions or disciplines.

#### Topic 8: future directions

   - Speculate on the future of data-driven ecological research. How might advancements in technology and the adoption of open science further transform the field?
   - Identify emerging challenges and opportunities, such as the need for robust data management practices, ethical considerations surrounding data use, and the potential for citizen science to contribute valuable ecological data.

### Assessment criteria

The class' essay will be evaluated on:

- Depth of understanding of ecological data sources and their applications.
- Critical evaluation of the strengths and limitations of different data types and platforms.
- Clarity and coherence in explaining data integration methods and technological advancements.
- Relevance and depth of the case studies chosen.
- Reflection on the broader implications of open science and technology for ecological research.
- A weighted individual mark will be generated based on your personal contributions (volume and quality) to the the essay. 

### Additional instructions

Please work as a class on this essay/lecture series. Provide a schema that shows me how work has been allocated to individuals within the class. This schema should be included as a separate document and I will use it to generate a weighting for individual marks. All tasks must selected so that they contribute to the overall coherence and quality of the document, and each much carry equal weight in terms of the final mark, and time required to complete the task.

Your goal is to provide a **professional, well-structured, and information-rich** document. Here, professional applies to presentation (formatting, and appearance) *and* content (quality of content, narrative, and language).

The maximum length of the essay should not exceed 40-50 pages, excluding references.

At the end, five, or six individuals will present the material to the class as a series of three 30-minute lectures. These individuals will be chosen based on their contributions to the essay, and their ability to present the material in a clear and engaging manner.

The points below will address some of the written presentation aspects:

1.	Use [**citations and footnotes**](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html) (including bibliography files and the automatic generation of bibliographies)---through collective effort by the class, you will learn how these tools work. To this end, 10% of the marks will assess your ability to use these facilities to their fullest extent.

2. The typology of data types can be presented as flow diagrams. Should you wish to include diagrams, please use [**Mermaid Diagrams**](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/diagrams.html) within Quarto. Again, the combined class effort will quickly bring you towards grasping, and understanding the concepts.

3. Should diagrams not be to your liking or not suited to your specific requirement, [**markdown tables**](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/tables.html) might be a better option for presenting structured information.

4. [**Figures**](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html) can also be inserted into Quarto documents if needs be.

5. To ensure easy use, provide your html file as a [**self-contained**](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html#self-contained) document by inserting the necessary options in your Quarto document's YAML header.

### Content

To arrive at professional content (emphasis on the language component of professional content), please feel free to use ChatGPT. However, I want to see two versions of your document: 

* the **first version** will show the essay in your own words, prior to applying ChatGPT polish

* the **second version** will have the grammatical, punctuation, grammar, and language checked by ChatGPT

For example, consider the following text produced by a student:

> Thin and elongated structures are essential for plants, this structures increase the surface area of the plants. Having a large surface area ensures that the mass f the plant is exposed to the sun, and the environment around it. The plants will have large  sa/v ratios, the plants will be dominated with physiological processes thus increasing their of photosynthesis because the ability oof diffusion is much faster.

In ChatGPT, construct the following prompt:

> Correct the language and grammar: "Thin and elongated structures are essential for plants, this structures increase the surface area of the plants. Having a large surface area ensures that the mass f the plant is exposed to the sun, and the environment around it. The plants will have large  sa/v ratios, the plants will be dominated with physiological processes thus increasing their of photosynthesis because the ability oof diffusion is much faster."

It will return the improved text:

> Thin and elongated structures are vital for plants, as these structures augment the plant's surface area. A larger surface area ensures that a substantial portion of the plant mass is exposed to the sun, and its surrounding environment. As a result, plants will exhibit large surface area to volume (SA/V) ratios. Such plants will be characterized by dominant physiological processes, thereby enhancing their photosynthesis rates due to faster diffusion capabilities.

<!-- If you want to learn about your writing mistakes, construct this prompt: -->

<!-- > What is wrong with this text: ""Thin and elongated structures are essential for plants, this structures increase the surface area of the plants. Having a large surface area ensures that the mass f the plant is exposed to the sun, and the environment around it. The plants will have large  sa/v ratios, the plants will be dominated with physiological processes thus increasing their of photosynthesis because the ability oof diffusion is much faster."" -->

<!-- You will receive the following response (together with the suggested improvement, which I do not show): -->

<!-- > The text contains a few grammatical errors, incorrect use of punctuation, and some typographical mistakes: -->
<!-- > -->
<!-- > Incorrect Pronoun Agreement: "this structures" should be "these structures". -->
<!-- > -->
<!-- > Missing Punctuation: A semicolon or period is required between "essential for plants" and "this structures". -->
<!-- > -->
<!-- > Typographical Error: "mass f the plant" should be "mass of the plant". -->
<!-- > -->
<!-- > Redundancy: "the plants" is repeated unnecessarily. -->
<!-- > -->
<!-- > Incorrect Preposition: "dominated with" should be "dominated by". -->
<!-- > -->
<!-- > Omission of Word: "increasing their of photosynthesis" should be "increasing their rate of photosynthesis". -->
<!-- > -->
<!-- > Typographical Error: "ability oof diffusion" should be "ability of diffusion". -->

<!-- Used wisely in this way, ChatGPT will improve your writing (seen in the second version), but the content, and structure of the writing will remain entirely your responsibility (assessed in the first version). -->
