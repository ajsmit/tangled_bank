## Task A

Ecologists use diverse data sources, including open data repositories and data obtained through field campaigns, to address questions about ecological communities across various scales of time and space. Discuss how different data types can be accessed, integrated, and utilised in studying ecological patterns and processes. Your considered and detailed response should: 

1.	Define and differentiate open data and field campaign data in the context of ecological studies.
2.	Develop a typology for the types ecologists access to advance the theory of ecological communities.
3.	Provide specific examples of databases or data repositories for open and field campaign data.
4.	Discuss the strengths and limitations of the main classes of data types.
5.	Describe methods for integrating these data sources and why this is beneficial.
6.	Provide specific examples of studies or scenarios where open and field campaign data have been used to enhance our understanding of ecological communities across different spatial and temporal scales.
7.	Reflect on the role of technology, including advancements in data analytics and computational models, in accessing, analysing, and integrating these data sources.

Your essay should demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the use of data in ecology and how it can be harnessed to yield valuable insights into the dynamics and patterns of ecological communities across different scales.

## Additional instructions

Your goal is to provide a **professional, well-structured, and information-rich** document. Here, professional applies to presentation (formatting and appearance) *and* content (quality of content, narrative, and language).

The maximum length of the essay should not exceed 10 pages, excluding references.

### Presentation
The points below will address some of the presentation aspects:

1.	Use [**citations and footnotes**](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html) (including bibliography files and the automatic generation of bibliographies)---through collective effort by the class, you will learn how these tools work. To this end, 10% of the marks will assess your ability to use these facilities to their fullest extent.

2. The typology of data types can be presented as flow diagrams. Should you wish to include diagrams, please use [**Mermaid Diagrams**](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/diagrams.html) within Quarto. Again, the combined class effort will quickly bring you towards grasping and understanding the concepts.

3. Should diagrams not be to your liking or not suited to your specific requirement, [**markdown tables**](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/tables.html) might be a better option for presenting structured information.

4. [**Figures**](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html) can also be inserted into Quarto documents if needs be.

5. To ensure easy use, provide your html file as a [**self-contained**](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html#self-contained) document by inserting the necessary options in your Quarto document's YAML header.

### Content

To arrive at professional content (emphasis on the language component of professional content), please feel free to use ChatGPT. However, I want to see two versions of your document: 

* the **first version** will show the essay in your own words, prior to applying ChatGPT polish

* the **second version** will have the grammatical, punctuation, grammar, and language checked by ChatGPT

For example, consider the following text produced by a student:

> Thin and elongated structures are essential for plants, this structures increase the surface area of the plants. Having a large surface area ensures that the mass f the plant is exposed to the sun and the environment around it. The plants will have large  sa/v ratios, the plants will be dominated with physiological processes thus increasing their of photosynthesis because the ability oof diffusion is much faster.

In ChatGPT, construct the following prompt:

> Correct the language and grammar: "Thin and elongated structures are essential for plants, this structures increase the surface area of the plants. Having a large surface area ensures that the mass f the plant is exposed to the sun and the environment around it. The plants will have large  sa/v ratios, the plants will be dominated with physiological processes thus increasing their of photosynthesis because the ability oof diffusion is much faster."

It will return the improved text:

> Thin and elongated structures are vital for plants, as these structures augment the plant's surface area. A larger surface area ensures that a substantial portion of the plant mass is exposed to the sun and its surrounding environment. As a result, plants will exhibit large surface area to volume (SA/V) ratios. Such plants will be characterized by dominant physiological processes, thereby enhancing their photosynthesis rates due to faster diffusion capabilities.

<!-- If you want to learn about your writing mistakes, construct this prompt: -->

<!-- > What's wrong with this text: ""Thin and elongated structures are essential for plants, this structures increase the surface area of the plants. Having a large surface area ensures that the mass f the plant is exposed to the sun and the environment around it. The plants will have large  sa/v ratios, the plants will be dominated with physiological processes thus increasing their of photosynthesis because the ability oof diffusion is much faster."" -->

<!-- You will receive the following response (together with the suggested improvement, which I do not show): -->

<!-- > The text contains a few grammatical errors, incorrect use of punctuation, and some typographical mistakes: -->
<!-- > -->
<!-- > Incorrect Pronoun Agreement: "this structures" should be "these structures". -->
<!-- > -->
<!-- > Missing Punctuation: A semicolon or period is required between "essential for plants" and "this structures". -->
<!-- > -->
<!-- > Typographical Error: "mass f the plant" should be "mass of the plant". -->
<!-- > -->
<!-- > Redundancy: "the plants" is repeated unnecessarily. -->
<!-- > -->
<!-- > Incorrect Preposition: "dominated with" should be "dominated by". -->
<!-- > -->
<!-- > Omission of Word: "increasing their of photosynthesis" should be "increasing their rate of photosynthesis". -->
<!-- > -->
<!-- > Typographical Error: "ability oof diffusion" should be "ability of diffusion". -->

<!-- Used wisely in this way, ChatGPT will improve your writing (seen in the second version), but the content and structure of the writing will remain entirely your responsibility (assessed in the first version). -->

## Submission instructions

Submit an essay structured under well-defined and logical headings by Tuesday, 27 June, by no later than 08:00.

Provide your essay as a **professional** Quarto-generated html file.

Please label the Quarto and resulting HTML files as follows:

-   `BCB743_<first_name>_<last_name>_Task_A.qmd`, and

-   `BCB743_<first_name>_<last_name>_Task_A.html`

(the `<` and `>` must be omitted as they are used in the example as field indicators only).

Failing to follow these instructions carefully, precisely, and thoroughly will cause you to lose marks, which could cause a significant drop in your score as formatting counts for 15% of the final mark (out of 100%).
