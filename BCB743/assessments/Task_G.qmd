## Task G

This task uses the data described at the start of the Chapter 5 about [Multiple Regression](../../docs/The-Biostatistics-Book-Ch-3-5.pdf) in The Biostatistics Book. The data can be downloaded [here](../../data/seaweed/spp_df2.csv).

In this task you will develop data analysis, undertake model building, and provide an interpretation of the findings. Your goal is to explore the species composition and assembly processes of the seaweed flora around the coast of South Africa. See @smit2017seaweeds for more information about the data and the analysis.

a. **Analysis:** Please develop multiple linear regression models for the seaweed species composition ($\beta_\text{sim}$ and $\beta_\text{sne}$, i.e. columns called `Y1` and `Y2`, respectively) using the all the predictors in this dataset. At the end, the final model(s) that best describe(s) the species assembly processes operating along the South African coast should be presented. The final model may/may not contain all the predictors in the dataset, and it is your goal to justify the variable and model selection.

    - Accomplishing a) will require that you work through the whole model-building process as outlined in the chapter. This includes the following steps:
        - Data exploration and visualisation (EDA)
        - Model building (providing hypothesis statements, variable selection using VIF and forward selection, comparisons of nested models, justifications for model selection)
        - Model diagnostics
        - Explanation of `summary()` and `anova()` outputs
        - Producing the Results section
        - **[60%]**

b. **Interpretation:** Once you have arrived at the best model, discuss your findings in the light of the appropriate ecological hypotheses that might explain the relationships between the predictors and the seaweed species composition. Include insights drawn from the analysis of $\beta_\text{s√∏r}$ that I developed in the Multiple Regression chapter, and also rely on the theory you have developed for the lecture material the class presented in Task A2.

    - Accomplishing b) is thus all about model interpretation and discussing the ecological relevance of the results.
    - **[40%]**
    
The format of this task is a Quarto file that will be converted to an HTML file. The HTML file will contain the graphs, all calculations, and the text sections. The task should be written up as a publication (i.e. use appropriate headings) using a journal style of your choice. Aside from this, there are no limitations.

## Submission instructions

Submit a R script wherein you provide answers to the questions by no later than 23:59 on 8 July 2024.

Provide a **neat and thoroughly annotated** Quarto/html files which outlines the graphs and all calculations and which displays the resultant distance matrix. Use separate tabs for the different questions.

Please label the Quarto and resulting HTML files as follows:

-   `BCB743_<first_name>_<last_name>_Task_G.qmd`, and

-   `BCB743_<first_name>_<last_name>_Task_G.html`

(the `<` and `>` must be omitted as they are used in the example as field indicators only).

Failing to follow these instructions carefully, precisely, and thoroughly will cause you to lose marks, which could cause a significant drop in your score as formatting counts for 15% of the final mark (out of 100%).

Submit your Labs on iKamva when ready.
