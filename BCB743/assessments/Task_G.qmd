This task uses the data described at the start of the Chapter 5 about [Multiple Regression](../../docs/The-Biostatistics-Book-Ch-3-5.pdf) in The Biostatistics Book. The data can be downloaded [here](../../data/seaweed/seaweed.zip).

Please also refer to the chapter [Deep Dive into Gradients](../deep_dive.qmd) for the data description, and the chapter [Seaweeds in Two Oceans: Beta-Diversity (Appendices)](../Seaweed_in_Two_Oceans_v2/two_oceans_appendices.qmd) for more information about the analyses in the paper. The publication that captures all the data and analyses is @smit2017seaweeds.

In this task, you will develop a comprehensive data analysis, undertake model building, and provide an interpretation of the findings. In Questions 1--3, your goal is to explore and analyse the species composition and assembly processes of the seaweed flora around the coast of South Africa. Question 4 requires integrating the preceding analyses into a coherent narrative in the form of a scientific paper. Question 5 is a reflection and assessment of theoretical concepts covered in the course, testing critical thinking about variable and model selection.

Begin by thoroughly reading the chapter on [Model Building](../model_building.qmd), then complete Questions 1--3:

## Question 1

**Unconstrained Ordinations:** Use an unconstrained analysis of your choice to explore the species data ($\beta_\text{sim}$ and $\beta_\text{sne}$, represented by columns `Y1` and `Y2` in the dataset) in various meaningful ways. In typical exploratory data analysis (EDA), unconstrained methods can be helpful. Consider including univariate maps that highlight the distribution of species composition along the coast of South Africa or indicate the existence of spatial gradients, using functions like `envfit()` or `ordisurf()`.

Note: The data in `Y1` and `Y2` cannot be used directly, but you'll have to use the data in `SeaweedSpp.csv` to calculate the dissimilarity matrices and then use the `Y1` and `Y2` matrices in your calculations. Matching environmental data in a compatible format are in `SeaweedEnv.RData`. Both these datasets will be in the ZIP file downloadable above.

## Question 2

**MLR Analyses:** Develop multiple linear regression models for the seaweed species composition (`Y1` and `Y2`) using all available predictors. Present the final model(s) that best describe the species assembly processes along the South African coast. The final model may or may not include all the predictors, and you must justify your variable and model selection.

## Question 3

**Constrained Ordination:** Focusing on `Y1` and `Y2`, apply a suitable constrained ordination technique to the data and compare the results with the multiple regression models. Discuss the differences and similarities between the two approaches.

### Notes on Questions 1--3 {.unnumbered}

**[35% towards Task G]**

To complete Questions 1--3, follow the model-building process outlined in the [Model Building](../model_building.qmd) chapter. This includes:

- Guiding the reader through your approach and rationale for the study, commenting on how and why certain methods are used.
- Using Quarto's [Code Annotations](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/code-annotation.html) to explain key portions of your code, such as specific functions or important arguments.
- Providing a detailed explanation of what the results mean in the context of the specific methodology employed (not in terms of the ecological theory, which is covered in Question 4).
- Describing which variables are used in your analyses and why.
- Conducting data exploration and visualisation (EDA).
- Building models (including hypothesis statements, variable selection using VIF and forward selection, comparisons of nested models, and justifications for variable and model selection).
- Performing model diagnostics (when appropriate).
- Explaining the outputs of `summary()`, `anova()` and any figures (as applicable)---i.e. explain results in context of the stats methods used.
- Discussing the results in the context of the methodology used.
- Not yet discussing the ecological findings, as that is reserved for Question 4.

## Question 4

**Formal Write-up:** Integrate your results (from the unconstrained ordination, MLR, and constrained ordination) with ecological theory in the format of a scientific publication. In other words, adhere to all the expectations of a journal article. Discuss your findings in light of the appropriate ecological hypotheses that might explain the relationships between the predictors and the seaweed species composition. This section should be written as if for a peer-reviewed publication and must include references. The aim is to analyse data about South Africa's seaweed flora and discuss the implications of the results in the context of ecological theory. Draw insights from the analysis of $\beta_\text{s√∏r}$ developed in the Multiple Regression chapter and rely on the theory from the lecture material developed in Task A2.

### Notes on Question 4 {.unnumbered}

**[35% towards Task G]**

Question 4 focuses on model interpretation and discussing the ecological relevance of the results. The paper must have the following sections:

- **Abstract:** A brief summary of the study and the main findings.
- **Introduction:** Introduction (background, rational, justification, etc.), including the aims and hypotheses to be tested.
- **Methods:** Combine and condense the detailed narrative developed for Questions 1--3 into a format suitable for publication. Include a description of the data, methods used, and analyses performed.
- **Results:** Combine the results from Questions 1--3 and present them in a way suitable for a peer-reviewed publication. Include tables and figures as needed. This means that you should present results in the context of the ecological questions being addressed (as appropriate for publications) not in the context of the stats you applied (which was assessed in Questions 1--3).
- **Discussion:** Include a detailed interpretation and discussion of the results. Discuss the implications of the findings in the context of ecological theory, similarities and contrasts with other similar studies, consideration of the limitations of the study, and suggest future research directions.
- **References:** Add references liberally throughout. Try and refrain from citing papers already cited by @smit2017seaweeds.

## Question 6

As an educational reviewer, you are tasked with evaluating the BCB743 course for an article on advanced ecological studies worldwide. Based on concrete examples taken from the course material available to students, your balanced review should assess the positives and negatives around the course's scope, content, and approach within the context of similar international offerings.

Analyse the strengths and weaknesses of BCB743, comparing its depth of theory, practical applications, and learning outcomes to other programs. Consider how well it aligns with current academic trends and emerging technologies in ecological research. Œ•our target audience comprises students and scholars seeking accredited training in modern quantitative ecological methods. They will use your evaluation to inform their educational choices.

Since the review will also assist the instructor, offer constructive feedback for course improvement and study guidance. Your review should be detailed, balanced, and professional, using specific examples to support your arguments. Compare BCB743 with benchmark programs from renowned institutions to provide concrete reference points.

The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights that will enhance the quality and effectiveness of BCB743 in preparing students for careers in quantitative ecology.
