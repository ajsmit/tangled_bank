## Lecture Series Assignment: Ecological Theories of Niche Models and Neutral Processes

Ecological theories form the foundation of our understanding of the complex interactions and processes that govern the natural world. These theories provide frameworks for studying how organisms interact with each other and their environment, how communities and ecosystems are structured, and how they change over time. By integrating concepts from biology, geography, and environmental science, ecological theories help us decipher the patterns of biodiversity, the distribution of species, and the flow of energy and nutrients within ecosystems. Key ecological theories, such as niche theory and neutral theory, offer insights into the mechanisms driving species coexistence, adaptation, and evolution, guiding both theoretical research and practical conservation efforts. Through these theoretical lenses, ecologists can develop predictive models, inform management strategies, and address pressing environmental challenges in a rapidly changing world.

**Objective**: Prepare a series of six lectures to understand and present the ecological theories of niche models and neutral processes. Focus on the foundational principles, methodologies, key studies, and implications of these theories in ecology, including practical approaches for modelling in R.

**Approach**: Work as a class and partition the lectures among the group members. Each member will be responsible for preparing and presenting one lecture, with the group collaborating to ensure a cohesive and comprehensive series. The lectures should include a mix of theoretical concepts, practical applications, case studies, and hands-on exercises to engage the audience and enhance learning.

**Due Date**: 11 July 2024

#### Lecture Series Structure

#### Lecture 1: Introduction to Ecological Theories

- **Objective**: Provide an overview of ecological theories, focusing on niche models and neutral processes.
- **Content**:
  - Definition and importance of ecological theories.
  - Introduction to niche models and neutral processes.
  - Historical context and development of these theories. Focus on key contributors (authors and texts) and milestones.
  - State-of-the-art.
  - Relevance to contemporary ecological research.
- **Approach**: Use lecture slides and key readings to introduce the main concepts and historical context.

#### Lecture 2: Niche Theory Fundamentals

- **Objective**: Understand the fundamental principles of niche theory.
- **Content**:
  - Definition of ecological niches.
  - Types of niches: fundamental and realised.
  - Hutchinson's niche concept.
  - Factors influencing niches (abiotic and biotic).
- **Approach**: Use slides, diagrams, and examples to illustrate the concepts. Include interactive elements such as quizzes or discussions.

#### Lecture 3: Niche Models and Applications

- **Objective**: Explore the methodologies and applications of niche models.
- **Content**:
  - Types of niche models (e.g., correlative vs. mechanistic).
  - Common niche modeling techniques (e.g., MaxEnt, ENM, GARP).
  - Data requirements and sources.
  - Practical approaches for modeling niche models in R.
  - Case studies demonstrating the application of niche models.
- **Approach**: Present case studies and discuss software. Include hands-on exercises or demonstrations to familiarize students with niche modelling techniques in R.

#### Lecture 4: Neutral Theory Fundamentals

- **Objective**: Understand the principles of neutral theory in ecology.
- **Content**:
  - Definition and assumptions of neutral theory.
  - Comparison with niche theory.
  - Key concepts: species equivalence, stochasticity, and dispersal limitation.
- **Approach**: Use conceptual diagrams and compare and contrast with niche theory to clarify differences.

#### Lecture 5: Applications of Neutral Models

- **Objective**: Explore the methodologies and applications of neutral models.
- **Content**:
  - Neutral models in practice.
  - Key studies and findings from neutral theory.
  - Limitations and criticisms of neutral models.
  - Practical approaches for modelling neutral models in R.
  - Integration with niche models.
- **Approach**: Use case studies and example models. Include critical discussion sessions to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of neutral models. Demonstrate how to implement neutral models in R.

#### Lecture 6: Comparative Analysis and Integration

- **Objective**: Analyse case studies that compare niche and neutral models and discuss their integration.
- **Content**:
  - Detailed analysis of specific ecological studies.
  - Comparison of outcomes from niche vs. neutral models.
  - Implications for ecological theory and practice.
  - Theoretical frameworks that combine both approaches.
  - Key unknowns, debates, future directions, and research opportunities.
- **Approach**: Present in-depth case studies and facilitate group discussions to compare findings. Use theoretical discussions and examples of integrated approaches.

## Tips

- **Research Thoroughly**: Ensure you have a strong understanding of both niche and neutral theories. Use a variety of sources including textbooks, peer-reviewed articles, and reputable online resources.
- **Engage Your Audience**: Use visuals, case studies, and interactive elements to keep the audience engaged.
- **Balance Theory and Practice**: Include both theoretical background and practical applications in each lecture.
- **Encourage Critical Thinking**: Prompt discussions and critical evaluations of the theories.
- **Use Real-World Examples**: Demonstrate the relevance of the theories with current research and real-world applications.
- **Provide Clear Summaries**: Conclude each lecture with a summary of key points to reinforce learning.
- **Collaborate and Share Resources**: Work with your peers to share insights and resources. Use collaborative tools for presentation preparation.

## Submission instructions

Submit an essay structured under well-defined and logical headings by Tuesday, 11 July 2024, by no later than 23:59.

Provide your essay as a **professional** Quarto-generated html files.

Please label the Quarto and resulting HTML files as follows:

-   `BCB743_2024_Task_A2_text.html` --- the textbook will have one submission for the class.

In addition, the presenters (different people to those who presented Task A1) will please submit their Quarto slides as follows:

-   `BCB743_2024_<first_name>_<last_name>_Task_A2_slides.html`

(the `<` and `>` must be omitted as they are used in the example as field indicators only).

Failing to follow these instructions carefully, precisely, and thoroughly will cause you to lose marks, which could cause a significant drop in your score as formatting counts for 15% of the final mark (out of 100%).

Submit your assignments on iKamva when ready.
