## About the data

Load some data produced in the analysis by @smit2017seaweeds. Please refer to the Chapter [Deep Dive into Gradients](06-deep_dive.qmd) for the data description.

This dataset is suitable for a multiple linear regression because it has continuous response variables ($\beta_\text{sÃ¸r}$, $\beta_\text{sim}$, and $\beta_\text{sne}$, the SÃ¸renesen dissimilarity, the turnover component of $\beta$-diversity, and the nestedness-resultant component of $\beta$-diversity, respectively), continuous predictor variables (the mean climatological temperature for August, the mean climatological temperature for the year, the temperature range for February and August, and the SD of February and August), and a categorial variable (the bioregional classification of the samples).

```{r}
seaweed <- read.csv("../data/seaweed/spp_df2.csv")
rbind(head(seaweed, 3), tail(seaweed, 3))[,-1]
```
