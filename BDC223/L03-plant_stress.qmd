# Content

- Identify and understand the suite of environmental properties (e.g. light, heat, water, nutrients, etc.) that are able to induce plant stress.
- Contextualise this understanding within the broader field of planetary change (global change and planetrary boundaries).
- Understand how climate change, specifically, is altering the environmental properties that induce plant stress.
- Link these environmental properties to the physiological and morphological responses of plants to stress.
- Understand the role of plant stress in shaping plant ecophysiological well being (e.g. the concept of relience).
- Understand the notions of stress resistance, stress avoidance, and succeptibility to stress in the context of plant stress.

# Aims

In this lecture, I will introduce you to the concept of plant stress and the environmental factors that induce stress responses in plants. You will explore the key environmental properties---such as light, temperature, water, and nutrients---that influence plant physiology and lead to stress under certain conditions. The lecture will place this understanding in the broader context of planetary change, particularly climate change, and its impact on the environmental properties that shape plant stress. Additionally, you will learn how plants respond to stress through physiological and morphological adaptations, and how these responses influence plant resilience and overall ecological health. The lecture will also cover the concepts of stress resistance, stress avoidance, and susceptibility to stress. As such, you will understand the diverse strategies plants use to survive in changing environments.

# Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. Identify the suite of environmental properties (light, temperature, water, nutrients, etc.) that are capable of inducing stress in plants, and explain how these factors interact with plant physiology.
2. Contextualise plant stress within the broader framework of planetary change, particularly in relation to global environmental shifts and the concept of planetary boundaries.
3. Understand how climate change is altering environmental properties in ways that exacerbate plant stress, and recognise the long-term implications for plant ecophysiology and survival.
4. Link specific environmental stress factors to the physiological and morphological responses of plants, explaining how plants adapt or fail to adapt to stress conditions.
5. Explain the role of plant stress in shaping overall plant ecophysiological well-being, particularly through the concept of resilience, and how stress affects plant productivity and survival.
6. Understand the concepts of stress resistance, stress avoidance, and susceptibility to stress, and apply these notions to different plant species and ecosystems in the context of environmental stressors.
