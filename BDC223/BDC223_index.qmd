Plants and other photo-oxygenic organisms are foundational to most life on Earth. They form part of complex interactions with the non-living and living world, and are severely being impacted by many of the components of global change. In this module, BDC223, we will explore the fundamental concepts, characteristics, and driving forces that shape and maintain plant-based productivity across Earth.

The pages for BDC223 are still being developed. Please check back later for more content.
