# BDC223 Prose Edit Report

## Scope and approach
- Expanded contractions, normalised apostrophes/quotes to ASCII, and standardised spaced em dashes in prose across all BDC223 `.qmd` files.
- Corrected British spelling where clear (e.g., kilometres, vapour), fixed typos, and adjusted grammar/punctuation (Oxford commas) in the edited files listed below.
- Converted selected passive constructions to active voice where the subject was clear.

## File-specific edits (highlights)

### `BDC223/L00-introduction.qmd`
- Reworked multiple paragraphs into active voice and removed contractions for a more formal tone.
- Corrected typos (e.g., “introduce”), grammar, and punctuation; normalised dash usage and spacing.
- Clarified phrasing around expectations, consultation, and assessments.

### `BDC223/L01-worldmapper.qmd`
- Cleaned up introduction wording and reduced repetition.
- Clarified several sentences for flow, switched passive to active voice, and removed evaluative phrasing (e.g., “overpopulated”).
- Standardised terminology (e.g., Global North) and corrected minor style/grammar issues.

### `BDC223/BDC223_index.qmd`
- Fixed grammar errors (“serves as”), typos (“headings”), and style issues (ad hoc, em dashes).
- Standardised time ranges to en dashes and adjusted Term/assessment labels for internal consistency.
- Simplified and clarified several guidance paragraphs; improved punctuation and Oxford comma usage.

### `BDC223/L02-SA_V.qmd`
- Fixed typos (e.g., “Littler and Littler’s”, “centimetres”), spacing errors, and punctuation.
- Clarified several long sentences and improved dash spacing in technical explanations.
- Corrected freshwater/roots phrasing in seaweed section for accuracy and flow.

## Recommendations, ambiguities, and potential inaccuracies
- `BDC223/L01-worldmapper.qmd`: The paragraph listing “$411$ million people” for Africa in 2050 conflicts with the bracketed note stating a projection of ~$2.5$ billion. Consider removing the $411$ million figure or reconciling the two values.
- `BDC223/L02-SA_V.qmd`: The source platform “eConver” is unclear. If this is a platform name, consider confirming the correct spelling or adding a short clarification.
- `BDC223/BDC223_index.qmd`: Confirm that Term 4 is correct for the Lab Assistant line and that “Class Test 2” on 16 Oct aligns with your assessment plan elsewhere in the module.
- `BDC223/BDC223_index.qmd`: The essay instruction “No internal section headings” may be clearer as “Do not use internal section headings” to avoid any ambiguity.
- `BDC223/L01-worldmapper.qmd`: Consider verifying the exact paper title “A Safe Operating Space for Humanity” and the author spelling (Rockstrom vs. Rockström) to align with your preferred citation style.

## Notes on style consistency
- If you want a uniformly formal register, consider replacing colloquial phrases such as “go and download it” and “have a look” (found elsewhere in the BDC223 lectures) with more formal alternatives.
- Several long, multi-clause sentences remain in later sections; splitting them could improve readability for students who are new to the material.
