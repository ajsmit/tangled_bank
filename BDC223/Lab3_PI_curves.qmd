## Experimental Procedure: Photosynthesis-Irradiance (P-I) Curve

In this experiment, you will measure the photosynthetic response of *Elodea* sp. plants at varying light intensities. You will quantify the amount of oxygen produced at each photon flux density and use these data to calculate the photosynthetic rate and create a Photosynthesis-Irradiance (P-I) curve. By plotting the P-I curve, you will visually estimate the maximum photosynthetic rate ($P_{\text{max}}$), the initial slope of the curve ($\alpha$), the light compensation point (LCP), and the respiration rate ($R$) based on the modified Jassby and Platt model.

### Materials

- *Elodea* sp. plants (approximately 4.5 g per replicate)
- Aquatic medium for submerging plants
- Light source with adjustable intensities (0 to 550 μmol photons·m⁻²·s⁻¹)
- Oxygen probe or dissolved oxygen meter
- Incubation chamber (to control environmental conditions)
- Timer
- Data recording sheet

### Experimental Procedure

1. **Set up the experiment**:
   - Place the plant material (*Elodea* sp., weighed to between 4.42 and 4.69 g) in an aquatic medium within a closed incubation chamber.
   - Ensure that the oxygen probe is calibrated and submerged properly to continuously measure the oxygen concentration.
   - Adjust the light source to create different light intensity levels, starting from 0 μmol photons·m⁻²·s⁻¹ (dark conditions) and increasing incrementally up to around 550 μmol photons·m⁻²·s⁻¹.

2. **Measure oxygen evolution**:
   - For each light intensity, incubate the plants for approximately 600 seconds (10 minutes). Record the exact incubation time, as small variations in time may occur due to experimental conditions.
   - Measure the total amount of oxygen produced (or consumed) during each incubation period. Oxygen production indicates net photosynthesis, while oxygen consumption in dark conditions reflects respiration.
   - Repeat the measurements for five different replicates of plant mass to account for variability and obtain a robust data set.

3. **Record light intensities**:
   - For each replicate, ensure that you document the light intensity (μmol photons·m⁻²·s⁻¹) for each corresponding oxygen measurement. The intensity should vary from 0 μmol photons·m⁻²·s⁻¹ to about 550 μmol photons·m⁻²·s⁻¹ in a regular stepwise fashion, allowing you to cover a broad range of photosynthetically active radiation.

### Calculating the Photosynthetic Rate
To calculate the photosynthetic rate for each light intensity, follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total oxygen evolved**: Using the data recorded during the experiment, identify the total amount of oxygen evolved or consumed (in mg O₂) for each light intensity and for each replicate.

2. **Calculate the time in hours**:
   Convert the incubation time (in seconds) to hours. Use the formula:
   $$
   \text{Time (h)} = \frac{\text{Time (s)}}{3600}
   $$

3. **Determine the oxygen production rate per plant mass**:
   Calculate the oxygen production rate per gram of plant material per hour, using the formula:
   $$
   P(I) = \frac{\text{Total O}_2 \text{ evolved (mg)}}{\text{Time (h)} \times \text{Plant mass (g)}}
   $$
   This will give you the net photosynthetic rate $P(I)$ at each light intensity $I$, expressed in mg O₂ produced per gram per hour.

### Plotting the P-I Curve

1. **Create a plot**:
   - On graph paper or using plotting software, plot the net photosynthetic rate $P(I)$ (mg O₂·g⁻¹·h⁻¹) on the y-axis against the light intensity $I$ (μmol photons·m⁻²·s⁻¹) on the x-axis.

2. **Draw the fitted line**:
   - Using a smooth curve, fit the data points to represent the trend of photosynthesis at increasing light levels. The curve will initially show a steep increase as light intensity rises (due to light-limited photosynthesis), followed by a gradual plateau as the rate of photosynthesis approaches the maximum capacity of the plant ($P_{\text{max}}$).

3. **Identify the key parameters**:
   - From the curve, estimate:
     - **$P_{\text{max}}$**: The maximum photosynthetic rate, where the curve flattens.
     - **$\alpha$**: The initial slope of the curve, representing the efficiency of photosynthesis at low light levels.
     - **Light compensation point**: The point where the curve crosses the x-axis, indicating the light intensity at which net photosynthesis is zero.
     - **Respiration rate ($R$)**: The rate of oxygen consumption in the absence of light (when $I = 0$).

### Estimating the Jassby and Platt Model Parameters

The modified Jassby and Platt model is used to describe the relationship between light intensity and photosynthetic rate. The model equation is:

$$
P(I) = P_{\text{max}} \times \tanh\left(\frac{\alpha I}{P_{\text{max}}}\right) - R
$$

- **$P_{\text{max}}$** is the maximum rate of photosynthesis.
- **$\alpha$** is the initial slope of the P-I curve, representing the photosynthetic efficiency at low light levels.
- **$R$** is the dark respiration rate, calculated from the negative O₂ evolution in the absence of light.

Fit this equation to your data and estimate $P_{\text{max}}$, $\alpha$, and $R$. The light compensation point can also be derived from the model, as it is the light intensity where the net photosynthesis rate equals zero.

[This experiment has already been done for you and the data are provided below for your analysis.]{.my-highlight}

<!-- These data are for five replicates, each with different plant masses and variable incubation times. The students can use this data to calculate the photosynthetic rate in units of mg O₂ per gram per hour. -->

<!-- ## Parameters Used in Simulation: -->

<!-- - **Pmax**: 13.15 mg O₂·g⁻¹·h⁻¹ -->
<!-- - **α (alpha)**: 0.05 mg O₂·g⁻¹·h⁻¹·(μmol photons·m⁻²·s⁻¹)⁻¹ -->
<!-- - **Respiration Rate (R)**: 2.045 mg O₂·g⁻¹·h⁻¹ (calculated from the light compensation point) -->

<!-- ## Formula Used: -->

<!-- The net photosynthetic rate $P(I)$ at a given irradiance $I$ is calculated as: -->

<!-- $$ -->
<!-- P(I) = P_{\text{max}} \times \tanh\left(\frac{\alpha I}{P_{\text{max}}}\right) - R -->
<!-- $$ -->

<!-- ## Simulation Steps: -->

<!-- 1. **Calculate Net Photosynthetic Rate $P(I)$**: -->
<!--    - For each light intensity, compute $P(I)$ using the modified Jassby and Platt model. -->

<!-- 2. **Generate Incubation Times**: -->
<!--    - For each measurement, generate an incubation time $T$ from a normal distribution with a mean of 600 seconds and a standard deviation of 10 seconds. -->

<!-- 3. **Calculate Total O₂ Evolved**: -->
<!--    - Use the formula: -->
<!--      \[ -->
<!--      \text{Total O}_2 \text{ evolved} = P(I) \times \left(\frac{T}{3600}\right) \times \text{Plant Mass} -->
<!--      \] -->
<!--      - This yields the total O₂ evolved (or consumed) during the incubation period for each replicate. -->

<!-- 4. **Introduce Measurement Noise**: -->
<!--    - Add normally distributed random noise to simulate experimental variability (5% of the total O₂ evolved). -->

### Notes:

- **Negative Values**: Negative total O₂ evolved indicates net respiration (O₂ consumption) at low light intensities.
- **Variability**: Incubation times and O₂ measurements include random variability to simulate real experimental conditions.
- **Data Usage**: You can calculate the photosynthetic rate $P(I)$ using:
  $$
  P(I) = \frac{\text{Total O}_2 \text{ evolved}}{\left(\frac{T}{3600}\right) \times \text{Plant Mass}}
  $$
  - This will yield $P(I)$ in mg O₂·g⁻¹·h⁻¹.
