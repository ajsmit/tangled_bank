General Structure of the Rubric

Each Task is evaluated under the following axes:

1. Technical Accuracy (50%)
2. Depth of Analysis (20%)
3. Clarity and Communication (20%)
4. Critical Thinking (10%)

Each subcomponent is marked on a 0–100 scale, then scaled to its proportion of the task weight. For example, Task 5 is worth 30% of the total mark, so a sub-question like 5.1 (one of five) may contribute up to 6% if evenly weighted.



## Task 1: Initial Processing [10%]

  - Data reshaped into appropriate long format: 15%
  - Presence of appropriate columns (year, quarter, etc.): 10%
- Depth of Analysis (20%)
