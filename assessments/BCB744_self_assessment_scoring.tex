\section*{Daily Self-Assessment Tasks}
BCB744 (Introduction to R, and Biostatistics) relies on the expectation that you will engage in regular, honest self-reflection about your grasp of each dayâ€™s lecture content. The honesty of these reflections cannot be overstated: each task should be rated according to the mark allocation next to the criteria below.
These self-assessment marks will be kept on record and serve as an indicator of your progress.
\vspace{12pt}

\noindent Except for random checks to see if your self-assigned mark reflects reality (as judged by myself or a teaching assistant for how closely it aligns with the model answers), they will not be assessed. We will also discourage students from undertaking the Intro R Test and the Biostatistics Test if their self-assessment scores are consistently low.
\vspace{12pt}

\noindent For the Daily Self-Assessment Tasks to be effective, you must work alone on all of them.
\vspace{12pt}

\noindent All the tasks must be submitted by the deadline.

\section*{Assessment Criteria}
When assessing the tasks, pay attention to the following criteria:

{\small
\begin{longtable}{R{3.5cm} R{8.5cm} R{3cm}}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Criterion} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Marks Allocated} \\
    \midrule
    \textbf{Content} & Questions answered in order. Annotations included (metadata in file header, comments about code, ideas, and approach). & 10 \% \\
    \textbf{Code Formatting \& Presentation} & Application of R code conventions (e.g., spaces around \texttt{<-}, after \texttt{\#}, after commas; correct use of new lines for each \texttt{dplyr} function (lines end in \texttt{\%>\%}) or \texttt{ggplot} layer (lines end in \texttt{+}), etc.). Logical structure of document and thorough, consistent use of headings and subheadings. Appearance and attention to detail. Code runs correctly without errors. & 40 \% \\
    \textbf{Correct Answers} & Demonstrating the correctness of answers by comparing them to the model answers. Correctly labelled, publication quality figures. & 50 \% \\
    \bottomrule
\end{longtable}}
