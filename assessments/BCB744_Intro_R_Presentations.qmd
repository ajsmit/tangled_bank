## Presentation Guidelines

You are required to prepare a professional **4 to 6-minute presentation** on one of the assigned topics. **Topics will be assigned at random the day before your presentation**, and you will not have the option to change your assigned topic or the date on which you present. Each topic will be presented by a single individual.

You may use any presentation software of your choice, but your final slides **must be submitted in PDF format**. Your presentation will be evaluated based on the **quality of your slides** (attention to detail is crucial -- poorly designed slides will be penalised), the **depth of your understanding**, and your **ability to effectively communicate your insights to the class**. A good rule of thumb is to have one slide per minute of talking.

Your presentation should be built around **your own insights, reasoning, and critical engagement with the topic** -- not simply a summary of existing information. While you should be well-informed, your goal is to **analyse, interpret, and construct a well-supported argument**, rather than merely listing facts or describing concepts. Depth matters (I am, therefore, less concerned with breadth). Strong presentations will explore nuances, challenge assumptions, and offer a clear, reasoned perspective.

Your slides should be **well-structured and visually compelling**, serving as an effective tool to communicate your argument. They should enhance your delivery, not act as a script -- slides are for the benefit of the audience, not you! Using notes during your presentation is not allowed, and you will be penalised for exceeding the time limit.

Finally, to ensure that each student presents their own perspective, avoid incorporating visuals (unless required to demonstrate specific cases) -- this presentation is about your ideas, your reasoning, and your ability to communicate effectively.

## Assessment Guidelines

Each presentation will be evaluated based on the following five key criteria, with an integrated final score out of 100% ([Assessment Sheet](BCB744_presentation_scoring.pdf)). Marks are allocated to reflect both the depth of thought and the effectiveness of communication.

1. **Depth of Understanding (30%)**
  - Demonstrates a clear, well-developed grasp of the topic.
  - Goes beyond surface-level descriptionsâ€”engages with nuances, complexities, and key debates.
  - Provides a reasoned analysis, not just a factual summary.
  - Supports arguments with logical reasoning and, where applicable, well-selected evidence.

2. **Originality & Critical Thinking (25%)**
  - Demonstrates independent thought rather than reproducing information from sources.
  - Engages with the topic in a way that challenges assumptions or explores alternative viewpoints.
  - Avoids superficial arguments and instead constructs well-reasoned, persuasive perspectives.

3. **Communication & Delivery (20%)**
  - Presents with clarity, confidence, and engagementâ€”not simply reading from slides or notes.
  - Articulates ideas logically, ensuring a smooth flow of concepts.
  - Maintains good pacing (avoiding rushing or excessive pauses).
  - Uses appropriate tone, vocabulary, and emphasis to enhance comprehension.

4. **Slide Quality & Structure (15%)**
  - Slides are visually clean, well-organised, and reinforce key ideas (not overloaded with text).
  - Information is structured logically, following a coherent narrative.
  - Aesthetic choices (font, spacing, color contrast) enhance readability and engagement.

5. **Time Management & Adherence to Guidelines (10%)**
  - Presentation is within the 5 to 7-minute limit (penalty for exceeding or falling short).
  - Slides were submitted on time and in the correct format.
  - No use of notes (penalty applies for reliance on written prompts).

**Final Score: ______ / 100%**

[Presentations will contribute **20% to the Continuous Assessment mark** (10% each in Intro R and Biostatistics).]{.my-highlight}

## Submission Requirements

- **Deadline:** Submit your slides by **8:30 AM on the day of your presentation**.
