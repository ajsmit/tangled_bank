# Presentation Guidelines

You are required to prepare a professional **8 to 10-minute presentation** on one of the assigned topics. **Topics will be assigned at random**, and you will not have the option to change your assigned topic. Each topic will be presented by a single individual.

You may use any presentation software of your choice, but your final slides **must be submitted in PDF format**. Your presentation will be evaluated based on the **quality of your slides** (attention to detail is crucialâ€”poorly designed slides will be penalised), the **depth of your understanding**, and your **ability to effectively communicate your insights to the class**.

Submission Requirements:

- **Deadline:** Submit your slides by **8:30 AM on the day of your presentation**.
- **Submission Format:** Email your slides as a PDF attachment.
- **Email Subject Line:**
  - ðŸ“Œ BCB744 Presentation: [Your Name]
- **File Naming Convention:**
  - ðŸ“„ BCB744_Presentation_[Your_Name].pdf

Failure to adhere to these requirements may result in a grade penalty. Ensure that your slides are clear, well-structured, and visually professional.

Presentations will contribute **20% to the Continuous Assessment mark** (10% each in Intro R and Biostatistics).
