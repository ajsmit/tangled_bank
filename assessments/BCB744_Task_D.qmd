# 12, 13 & 14. Tidy Data

## Question 1

What are the key principles of tidy data? **(/3)**

`r if (params$hide_answers) "::: {.content-hidden}"`

**Answer**

- ✓ Each variable forms a column.
- ✓ Each observation forms a row.
- ✓ Each type of observational unit forms a table.

`r if (params$hide_answers) ":::"`

## ## Question 2

Using the tidy data (`SACTN2_tidy`) and untidy data (`SACTN2`), create line graphs, one for each of DEA, SAWS, and KZNSB, showing a time series of temperature. Ensure you have a column of three figures (`ncol = 1`). Use the fewest number of lines of code possible. You should end up with two graphs, each with three panels.

`r if (params$hide_answers) "::: {.content-hidden}"`

**Answer**



`r if (params$hide_answers) ":::"`
