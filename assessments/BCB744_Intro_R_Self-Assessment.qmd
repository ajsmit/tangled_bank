Here is a self-assessment worksheet for the *Introduction to R* portion of the BCB744 course, based on the provided sources. This worksheet is designed to help you gauge your understanding of the material covered in each lecture and provides resources for further practice.

# General Instructions

* Complete the practice exercises to test your skills.
* Submit your answers to each task's questions no later than 8:30 on the day after the corresponding lectures (e.g. Monday's lecture material is covered by Task A, and must be submitted on Tuesday morning no later than 8:30).
* You do not need to submit anything for the "Practice Exercises" -- those are for your own benefit.
* Immediately after we have gone over the task answers in the class (e.g. on Tuesday morning for Task A), rate your performance according to the [assessment sheet](BCB744_self_assessment_scoring.pdf). Fill your name in on the PDF and submit it on iKamva where it will be kept on record. Each day I'll randomly select five of the submitted tasks to check the honesty of your assessments. 
* Review the relevant course material if you find you are struggling with a section. Ask for help before it is too late! It is best to admit in class if you are falling behind so that others might benefit as well.

## 11. The Fiji Earthquake Data

**Understanding Level:** Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced

### Key Concepts

1. Working with real-world datasets.
2. Applying mapping skills to specific data.

### Practice Exercises

- Import the Fiji Earthquake data.
- Use a suitable map to represent the data, with size and colour varying with the magnitude and depth of earthquakes.

1. Please recreate the figure, above. You are welcome to reuse the code found on the website. 
2. When plotting the earthquakes, include **only** the earthquake data for earthquakes of magnitude greater than the 75th percentile.
3. Add a point for each of the main island nations in the South Pacific region. Ensure the point is correctly associated with the island name.
4. Ensure the map is correctly labelled and has a title, and is as close to publication quality as you can make it.

Your code needs to show all the steps (thoroughly annotated) leading to the final figure in point 4.

# Task D {#sec-task_D}

## 12, 13 & 14. Tidy Data

**Understanding Level:** Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced

### Key Concepts

1. Principles of tidy data.
2. Using **tidyr** for data reshaping.
3. Using **dplyr** for data wrangling.

### Practice Exercises

- Import a messy dataset and practice reshaping using `tidyr::pivot_longer()` and `tidyr::pivot_wider()`.
- Use **dplyr** to clean and manipulate data in the tidy format.

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Questions

1. What are the key principles of tidy data?
2. What are the differences between wide and long format data?
3. Using the tidy data (`SACTN2_tidy`) and untidy data (`SACTN2`), create line graphs, one for each of DEA, SAWS, and KZNSB, showing a time series of temperature. Ensure you have a column of three figures (`ncol = 1`). Use the fewest number of lines of code possible.

You should end up with two graphs, each with three panels.
