You may use any presentation software of your choice, but your final slides **must be submitted in PDF format**. Your presentation will be evaluated based on the **quality of your slides** (attention to detail is crucialâ€”poorly designed slides will be penalised), the **depth of your understanding**, and your **ability to effectively communicate your insights to the class**.

Submission Requirements:

- **Deadline:** Submit your slides by **8:30 AM on the day of your presentation**.
- **Submission Format:** Email your slides as a PDF attachment.

Failure to adhere to these requirements may result in a grade penalty. Ensure that your slides are clear, well-structured, and visually professional.
