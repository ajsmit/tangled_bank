# Part 4.1. Learning and Teaching

Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, I deftly navigated the situation by implementing innovative teaching methods, which I have been using since 2022. I now offer students a range of options to choose from, including pre-recorded video lectures on iKamva, traditional PowerPoint-type slides, detailed written materials, and in-person lectures. My undergraduate teaching approach revolves around utilising video lectures to deliver content and in-class sessions to stimulate discussion on complex topics while also exploring related subjects and problem-solving. To further engage BSc (Hons) students, I conduct interactive workshops, providing an immersive learning experience. In addition, I developed **The Tangled Bank**, a comprehensive website that functions both as an augmented online textbook and a learning guide. The website serves as a testament to my thorough teaching and learning approach and contains additional information about my teaching methodology, which can be found in the syllabi of specific modules (referenced as footnotes BDC334,  BCB744,  and BCB743 ). I take immense pride in being a lecturer who goes above and beyond the lecture theatre.
