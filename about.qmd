The aim of these workshops is to guide you through the basics of using R
via RStudio for analysis of environmental and biological data. The
workshop is laid out so it begins simply and slowly to impart the basics
of using R. It then gathers pace, so that by the end we are doing
intermediate level analyses. The first course, **Introduction to R**, is
ideal for people new to R or who have limited experience. This workshop
is not comprehensive, but is necessarily selective. We are not hardcore
statisticians, but rather ecologists who have an interest in statistics,
and use R frequently. Our emphasis is thus on the steps required to
analyse and visualise data in R, rather than focusing on the statistical
theory.

The next installment is **Biostatistics**. Here we emphasise the various
classes of data, distributions, hypothesis tests, and some basic
inferential statistics. We draw in the learnings of Intro R as we
manipulate our data and make various visualisations in support of the
hypotheses being tested.

The third workshop, **Quantitative Ecology**, is about community ecology
and not so much about population ecology. Community ecology underpins
the vast fields of biodiversity and biogeography, and concerns spatial
scales from squares of meters to all of Earth. We can look at
historical, contemporary, and future processes that have been implicated
in shaping the distribution of life on our planet. Two main groups of
multivariate statistics, 'classifications' and 'ordinations', take
central position in the modern-day ecologist's toolbox. This final
workshop will explore these ideas as we work with biodiversity data
across various scales time, space and complexity.

Don't worry if you feel overwhelmed and do not follow everything at any
time during the three Workshops; that is totally natural with learning a
new and powerful program. Remember that you have the notes and material
to go through the exercises later at your own pace; we will also be
walking the room during sessions and breaks so that we can answer
questions one-on-one. We hope that this Workshop gives you the
confidence to start incorporating R into your daily workflow, and if you
are already a user, we hope that it will expose you to some new ways of
doing things.

Finally, keep in mind that we are self-taught when it comes to R. Our
methods will work, but you will learn as you gain more experience with
programming that there are many ways to get the right answer or to
accomplish the same task.
