@node Robert H Whittaker's Role in Understanding Community Formation
@section Robert H. Whittaker's Role in Understanding Community Formation
Robert H. Whittaker (1920-1980) was instrumental in shaping our
understanding of ecological gradients and their role in species
community formation. He challenged the prevailing Clementsian view of
his time of communities as discrete, interdependent units, and instead
proposed the ``individualistic hypothesis'' (Whittaker 1953). This
hypothesis posited that species respond individually to environmental
gradients, resulting in gradual shifts in community composition along
these gradients.

Whittaker undertook extensive field research in diverse ecosystems, from
the Great Smoky Mountains to the Siskiyou Mountains. This work provided
strong empirical support for his hypothesis (Whittaker 1967). He
developed the ``gradient analysis'' method, a quantitative approach to
studying species distributions along environmental gradients, which
became a cornerstone of modern community ecology.

Whittaker's placed community ecology onto a new trajectory and shifted
the focus from discrete community types to the continuous variation of
species along environmental gradients. This shift is continuing to have
deep implications for our understanding of biodiversity patterns,
ecosystem functioning, and conservation strategies.

@node Environmental Gradients
@section Environmental Gradients
@image{../images/gradients1,,,,png}
Environmental gradients exist across space and time and link
biodiversity outcomes, which we may measure as structure and function,
to environmental properties @{@ref{#fig-gradients1,,Figure@ 1}). These
gradients can be observed through Earth observation technologies, such
as satellite remote sensing, which provide high-resolution spatial data
essential for understanding biogeography. Biogeographical patterns help
us discern how species distributions and community compositions vary in
response to different environmental factors such as temperature,
precipitation, and nutrient availability. We refer to these
environmental factors as @emph{drivers} when they affect
ecological---and ultimately, biogeographical---outcomes.

As we move from present to future scenarios, the data collected enable
us to use ecophysiological principles: that is, we use our understanding
of physiological processes of organisms and how they adapt to changing
environments. Long-term data are crucial for understanding global change
processes, such as climate change and nutrient cycles such as those
involving N, P, C, and Si, for example. These processes impact
ecological outcomes by altering ecosystem structure and function, and
can be studied using both classical ecological methods and modern
techniques like stable isotopes. These outcomes feed back into
biogeochemistry, linking the cycles of key elements to broader
ecological and environmental changes. This interconnected approach can
help us predict how ecosystems might respond to future environmental
shifts, emphasising the importance of integrating data across temporal
and spatial scales.

@node The Unimodal Model
@section The Unimodal Model
The `unimodal' model (@emph{sensu} Whittaker 1967) is a core concept in
ecology. It provides a framework for understanding how species and
communities are distributed along environmental gradients and offers an
intuitive explanation for the patterns we observe in nature.

The unimodal model posits that the relationship between a species'
abundance (or other measures such as biomass or relative frequency) and
its position along an environmental gradient follows a unimodal
function. This means that the abundance of a species typically peaks at
a specific point along the gradient where the conditions are `just
right' (to quote Goldilocks) and decreases as conditions deviate from
this optimum in either direction.

The model implies that each species has a unique set of optimal
conditions under which it thrives and attains maximal abundance. This
`sweet spot' represents the ideal combination of environmental factors
for that particular species. As conditions move away from this optimum,
whether becoming too hot or too cold, too wet or too dry, the species'
abundance decreases. This creates a characteristic bell-shaped curve
(@ref{#fig-coenocline,,Figure@ 2}) when plotting abundance against the
environmental gradient.

@verbatim
library(coenocliner)
set.seed(666)
M <- 3                                     # number of species
ming <- 3.5                                # gradient minimum...
maxg <- 7                                  # ...and maximum
locs <- seq(ming, maxg, length = 100)      # gradient locations
opt  <- runif(M, min = ming, max = maxg)   # species optima
tol  <- rep(0.25, M)                       # species tolerances
h    <- ceiling(rlnorm(M, meanlog = 3))    # max abundances
pars <- cbind(opt = opt, tol = tol, h = h) # put in a matrix

mu <- coenocline(locs, responseModel = "gaussian", params = pars,
                 expectation = TRUE)

matplot(locs, mu, lty = "solid", type = "l", xlab = "pH", ylab = "Abundance")
@end verbatim

The unimodal model is simple to understand and has a broad
applicability. It's trivial to conceptualise how species come to be
arranged or sorted along gradients based on their individual optimal
conditions and tolerance ranges. This sorting effect explains why we
often observe distinct changes in species composition as we move along
environmental gradients, such as elevation in mountains or moisture in
transitions from wetlands to uplands, or even across wider regional
gradients such as along a coastline influenced by a western boundary
current (e.g.@ Agulhas Current) or east to west across South Africa.
This gives rise to the ideas of @uref{L03-structure.qmd,distance-decay
relationships community structuring along elevation gradients}, and
species turnover, for all of which the outcome can be measured as
@uref{L02b-biodiversity.qmd#sec-beta-diversity,beta diversity}.

In real-world ecosystems, however, multiple gradients co-exist
simultaneously and the situation may be more complex than alluded to in
@ref{#fig-coenocline,,Figure@ 2}. Species are responding not just to one
environmental factor, but to a complex interplay of various gradients.
These might include temperature, precipitation, soil pH, nutrient
availability, and many others. As a result, communities---collections of
species coexisting in a given area---are formed within this
multidimensional `space' of gradients. Please see the section on
@uref{01-introduction.html#sec-gradients,coenoplanes and coenospaces}
for more information. To complicate things further, many types of biotic
interactions (e.g.@ competition, predation, mutualism) can also
influence species distributions and community assembly.

@node Fundamental and Realised Niches
@section Fundamental and Realised Niches
The formation of communities in this gradient space can be
conceptualised as the outcome of multiple interacting unimodal
species-environment relationships, modulated by complex biological
interactions. Each species in the community occupies a position that
reflects its response to various environmental gradients, shaped by its
physiological tolerances, competitive abilities, and other biotic
factors. This interplay leads to the complex patterns of species
composition and diversity we observe in nature.

To fully understand this process, we must consider the concepts of
fundamental and realised niches. The fundamental niche represents the
full range of environmental conditions under which a species could
potentially thrive in the absence of biotic interactions. In the context
of the unimodal model, this would correspond to the species' theoretical
response curves along various environmental gradients.

However, in real ecosystems, species rarely occupy their entire
fundamental niche. Instead, they occupy a realised niche, which is
typically a subset of the fundamental niche. The realised niche is
shaped by biotic interactions such as competition, predation, and
mutualism, as well as by dispersal limitations and historical factors.
In the gradient space, a species' realised niche is represented by its
actual measurable distribution and abundance patterns.

The interaction between fundamental and realised niches adds layers of
complexity to community formation. Competition may lead to niche
compression, where species occupy narrower niches than they are
physiologically capable of. Conversely, in the absence of competitors or
predators, species might experience niche expansion. Over time, niche
differentiation can occur as species evolve to reduce competition,
potentially altering their response to environmental gradients.

Moreover, some species exhibit niche plasticity, adjusting their
ecological roles in response to environmental changes or biotic
pressures. Others engage in niche construction, actively modifying their
environment and thereby altering the gradient space for themselves and
other species.

Understanding these dynamics is important if we wish to interpret the
complex patterns we observe and measure in nature. `Community assembly'
(note, not implying a deliberate act) is not simply a passive response
to existing gradients, but a dynamic process involving adaptation,
competition, and environmental modification. We must consider both
abiotic factors, as emphasised in the unimodal model, and the various
kinds of biotic interactions, as highlighted by the concept of realised
niches.

@node The Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity
@section The Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity
An alternative (or complementary?) hypothesis for community
formation---which we will not cover too much but you are nevertheless
required to understand the basic premise of---is the Unified Neutral
Theory of Biodiversity (UNTB). This theory posits that species in a
community are functionally equivalent and that their relative abundances
are determined by stochastic processes rather than by their individual
traits or interactions. In other words, the UNTB suggests that all
species are ecologically equivalent and that community composition is
the result of random dispersal, speciation, and extinction events.

UNTB:

@node Ceonoclines Ceonoplanes and Ceonospaces
@section Ceonoclines, Ceonoplanes, and Ceonospaces
Okay, a question about coenoclines. Before I explain, as I said in
earlier lectures, to best help you I need to understand what steps you
have already taken and where exactly you're still struggling. Please,
when you pose a question, indicate specifically what you've attempted
and where you're getting lost.

One student says they've not read the specific article for now but,
while reviewing topic two, could not find the corresponding figures
described in the material---especially those about when the `core inner
space' is greater or less than two, which caused confusion.

Let me address this by first clarifying what a coenocline is. Typically,
a coenocline is a visual, simplified representation of how a given
species responds to a single environmental gradient. For instance, as
you move across South Africa from east to west, rainfall typically
decreases: there's more rain in the east than in the west. This gradient
in rainfall is one example, and species are optimally distributed at
some point along the gradient---where rainfall best fits their
physiological needs.

However, rainfall isn't the only gradient influencing species
distributions. Soil chemistry and physics, temperature fluctuations,
atmospheric heat, and many other gradients also change simultaneously
across a landscape. While a coenocline explains the distribution of a
species along one gradient, real landscapes are far more complex: there
might be ten, twenty, even forty gradients at play, all influencing
species distributions at once.

A coenocline can be expanded to account for two or more gradients, and
then we call it a ceonoplane. When even more gradients are considered,
we refer to it as a ceonospace. The ceonospace defines a position in the
landscape, specified by multiple interacting gradients, in which species
are optimally distributed according to all their physiological
tolerances. These are just modelling tools---quantitative ecology uses
them to understand and predict distributions of individual species and
community structures across landscapes.

For those considering Honours, we shall dive much deeper into these
concepts, particularly quantitative ways of understanding community
structure.

Essentially, what I want you to understand about coenoclines,
ceonoplanes, and ceonospaces is that they allow us to model how multiple
co-varying environmental variables sort and distribute species.
Typically, species exhibit a unimodal distribution---their abundance
peaks at the environmental conditions that most closely match their
physiological optimum. Away from this `sweet spot' (not a scientific
term!), their abundance declines as conditions become less suitable.

Imagine a landscape gradient ranging from hot to cold. A species might
be most abundant where temperatures align with its tolerance. But at
every spot along that gradient, multiple factors---temperature,
humidity, soil conditions---are also varying. Each species in the
landscape responds similarly, preferring their own set of environmental
optima, and this interplay shapes the overall vegetation and animal
community structures that we observe.

So, to summarise: these tools---coenocline, ceonoplane,
ceonospace---help us model, using mathematics or quantitative methods,
the distribution of species and communities against the complexity of
environmental gradients. Their use forms a core framework of how we
understand community ecology.

If you're still unclear on any aspect, please do reflect on this answer.
I will post the video of this session again for you to review. Listen to
the explanation carefully, and if you get stuck, rephrase your question
at the point where my explanation loses you, so I can pinpoint precisely
where to build further understanding.

@node Environmental Gradients in South Africa
@section Environmental Gradients in South Africa
A student mentions that it gets drier from east to west across South
Africa. Yes, this is the case: the eastern side of South Africa is
adjacent to the warm Agulhas Current, which transports warm tropical or
subtropical water down the coast into the higher latitudes. As this warm
current flows past, evaporation adds heat and moisture to the
atmosphere. This, in turn, brings rainfall to the adjacent land. That is
why the eastern coast is so wet---characterised by tropical and
subtropical vegetation, an abundance of rivers, and nutrient-rich soils
leading to high productivity.

As you move westward into the centre of the country and then towards the
west coast, the influence of the Agulhas Current diminishes. There is
less moisture, less rainfall, fewer rivers, drier soil, and lower
humidity---altogether favouring a different suite of plant and animal
adaptations. By the time you reach the west, rainfall drops below
@math{400},mm/year, and only species adapted to very dry conditions are
present. In KwaZulu-Natal, by contrast, you may get as much as
@math{1,200},mm/year, or thereabouts.

The two major currents on the country's east and west coasts bring
different amounts of moisture into the atmosphere, exerting a strong
influence on the environmental gradients across the region, which in
turn mould distinctive ecological communities.

@node Ocean Currents and Regional Variation
@section Ocean Currents and Regional Variation
Another question: ``Do the two major currents mix at Cape Town?'' They
don't exactly mix at Cape Town itself, but rather in the region between
Cape Point and Cape Agulhas---a stretch of coastline approximately
@math{300},km long. There, the Indian and Atlantic oceans influence each
other, resulting in a transition zone in both marine and terrestrial
vegetation. The biological communities in this area reflect a blend of
species from the comparatively warmer east coast and the colder west
coast.

I authored a paper in 2017 entitled ``Seaweeds in Two Oceans'', which is
part of your required reading, explaining precisely how and why these
oceanic influences can be measured and how they shape biogeography. The
area between Cape Agulhas (the southernmost tip of Africa) and Cape
Point is where this mixing creates a transition---biogeographically, it
marks the boundary between the Benguela and Agulhas marine provinces,
each hosting distinct communities but with a measurable zone of overlap.

@node Atmospheric Pressure Weather and Climate
@section Atmospheric Pressure, Weather, and Climate
Another student asked whether humid conditions in the Western Cape are a
consequence of the Agulhas Current. In short, not really---not on short
timescales. While ocean currents set the broader climatic context and
have significant influences over months and years, the day-to-day
weather we feel (e.g., changes in humidity and temperature) is primarily
due to changes in atmospheric pressure systems. The ocean's heat content
changes slowly due to its high heat capacity, so it exerts a steady but
slow influence.

Day-to-day weather variations are mostly driven by atmospheric fronts
and systems. In the Western Cape, rain typically results from
low-pressure systems in the southeast Atlantic south of South Africa,
not directly from the Agulhas Current. The influence of the Agulhas
Current is strongest on the east coast; by the time the current rounds
the Agulhas Bank, most of its heat and moisture have already been
released.

Longer-term shifts---over years or decades, such as those driven by El
Niño or the displacement of large-scale atmospheric systems---do
ultimately tie back to oceanic cycles, but for weather on the scale of
days, it's mostly atmospheric.

For those interested in looking for longer-term patterns, analyses of
sea temperature and atmospheric pressure in the Western Cape reveal
subtle cycles up to @math{18} years long, which influence both weather
and biological communities, such as shifts in vegetation or fire
frequency. However, these are subtle, and are not generally perceived on
short timescales without data analysis.

@node Recap of Key Points
@section Recap of Key Points
The key point for you to remember in this module is that environmental
gradients---across rainfall, temperature, soil, and other
variables---imprint themselves on the structure of biological
communities. These gradients are frequently determined by major
influences such as ocean currents, but it is the sum of these factors,
and their interactions, that create the distinctive assemblages of
species we see across landscapes.
