        "\n",
        "Ordinations are multivariate statistical techniques used to analyse and\n",
        "visualise complex, high-dimensional data, such as ecological community\n",
        "data. While clustering methods (see Topic 13) focus on identifying\n",
        "discontinuities or groups within the data, ordinations aim to highlight\n",
        "and interpret gradients, which are ubiquitous in ecological communities.\n",
        "Ordinations are particularly well-suited for handling multivariate data,\n",
        "which can represent:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   A spatial context (e.g., a landscape) comprised of many sites\n",
        "    (rows), each one characterised by multiple variables (columns), such\n",
        "    as species abundances or environmental factors.\n",
        "-   A time series (e.g., repeated sampling) comprised of many samples\n",
        "    (rows), each one containing multiple variables (columns), such as\n",
        "    species or environmental variables.\n",
        "-   Multidimensional or multivariate data, where the number of\n",
        "    dimensions (columns) approaches the number of samples (sites or\n",
        "    times).\n",
        "\n",
        "In such complex, high-dimensional data, analysing each variable\n",
        "separately using a series of univariate or bivariate analyses would be\n",
        "inefficient and unlikely to reveal the underlying patterns accurately.\n",
        "For example, in the Doubs River dataset, a univariate approach would\n",
        "require (27 × 26) / 2 = 351 separate analyses, which is impractical and\n",
        "prone to misinterpretation.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Dimension Reduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Ordinations are dimension reduction methods. They:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Take high-dimensional data (many columns).\n",
        "-   Apply scaling and rotation.\n",
        "-   Reduce the complexity to a low-dimensional space (orthogonal axes).\n",
        "\n",
        "Ordinations represent the complex data along a reduced number of\n",
        "orthogonal axes (linearly independent and uncorrelated), constructed in\n",
        "such a way that they capture the main trends or gradients in the data in\n",
        "decreasing order of importance. Each orthogonal axis captures a portion\n",
        "of the variation attributed to the original variables (columns).\n",
        "Interpretation of these axes is aided by visualisations (biplots),\n",
        "regressions, and clustering techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "Essentially, ordinations geometrically arrange (project) sites or\n",
        "species into a simplified dataset, where distances between them in the\n",
        "Cartesian 2D or 3D space represent their ecological or species\n",
        "dissimilarities. In this simplified representation, the further apart\n",
        "the shapes representing sites or species are on the graph, the larger\n",
        "the ecological differences between them.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Analogy of what an ordination does**\n",
        ">\n",
        "> Imagine you have a 3D pear and a strong beam of light that casts the\n",
        "> pear’s shadow onto a flat surface. When you place the pear in the beam\n",
        "> of light, the shadow that forms on the surface represents a 2D\n",
        "> projection of the 3D object. Depending on how you rotate the pear, the\n",
        "> shadow can appear in different shapes. Sometimes, it looks like the\n",
        "> characteristic pear shape, while other times, it might resemble a\n",
        "> round disc or an elongated ellipse.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> ‘Projection’ in ordination works in a similar way. Consider the\n",
        "> original data as the 3D pear, existing in a high-dimensional space\n",
        "> where each dimension represents a different variable. The goal of\n",
        "> ordination is to find new axes (principal components) that capture the\n",
        "> most insightful variations in the data. These axes are akin to the\n",
        "> rotation of the pear in the beam light to cast the shadow.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> When you ‘project’ the data onto these new axes, you are essentially\n",
        "> rotating the pear in the light beam to create a 2D (or\n",
        "> lower-dimensional) shadow on a plane. This shadow, or projection,\n",
        "> represents the data in a reduced form. Just like rotating the pear\n",
        "> reveals different shapes of shadows, rotating the data (changing the\n",
        "> axes) in ordination can reveal different structures and patterns\n",
        "> within the data. Some rotations will clearly show the underlying\n",
        "> structure (e.g., the pear shape), while others might obscure it (e.g.,\n",
        "> the round disc).\n",
        ">\n",
        "> This process of projection helps in visualising complex,\n",
        "> high-dimensional data in a simpler form and makes it easier to\n",
        "> identify patterns, clusters, and relationships between variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "The axes are ordered by the amount of variation they capture, with the\n",
        "first axis capturing the most variation, the second axis capturing the\n",
        "second most, and so on. The axes are orthogonal, so they are\n",
        "uncorrelated. They are linear combinations of the original variables,\n",
        "making them interpretable.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Ordination primarily endeavours to represent sample and species\n",
        "relationships as faithfully as possible in a low-dimensional space”\n",
        "(Gauch, 1982). This is necessary because visualising multiple dimensions\n",
        "(species or variables) simultaneously in community data is extremely\n",
        "challenging, if not impossible. Ordination compromise between the number\n",
        "of dimensions and the amount of information retained. Ecologists are\n",
        "frequently confronted by 10s, if not 100s, of variables, species, and\n",
        "samples. A single multivariate analysis also saves time compared to\n",
        "conducting separate univariate analyses for each species or variable.\n",
        "What we really want is for the dimensions of this ‘low-dimensional\n",
        "space’ to represent important and interpretable environmental gradients.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Benefits of Ordinations\n",
        "\n",
        "An ecological reason for preferring ordinations over multiple univariate\n",
        "analyses is that species do not occur in isolation but in communities.\n",
        "Species in a community are interdependent and influenced by the same\n",
        "environmental factors. As such, community patterns may differ from\n",
        "population patterns. Some ordination methods can also offer insights\n",
        "into β diversity, which is the variation in species composition among\n",
        "sites.\n",
        "\n",
        "A statistical reason for avoiding multiple univariate analyses is the\n",
        "increased probability of making a Type I error (rejecting a true null\n",
        "hypothesis) with numerous tests, known as the problem of multiple\n",
        "comparisons. In contrast, multivariate analysis has a single test,\n",
        "enhancing statistical power by considering species in aggregate due to\n",
        "redundancy in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ordination focuses on ‘important dimensions,’ avoiding the\n",
        "interpretation of noise, thus acting as a ‘noise reduction technique’\n",
        "(Gauch, 1982). It allows determining the relative importance of\n",
        "different gradients, which is virtually impossible with univariate\n",
        "techniques. For example, one can assess whether the first axis\n",
        "represents a stronger gradient than the second axis.\n",
        "\n",
        "A major benefit of ordination is that its numeric output lends itself to\n",
        "graphical representation, often leading to intuitive interpretations of\n",
        "species-environment relationships. This is useful for communicating\n",
        "results to non-specialists.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Types of Ordinations\n",
        "\n",
        "The first type of ordination techniques includes **eigen-analysis\n",
        "methods**, which use linear algebra for dimensionality reduction. The\n",
        "second type of ordination techniques includes **non-eigen-analysis\n",
        "methods**, which use iterative algorithms for dimensionality reduction.\n",
        "I will cover both classes in this lecture, with non-Metric\n",
        "Multidimensional Scaling being the only example of the second class.\n",
        "\n",
        "The eigen-analysis methods produce outputs called eigenvectors and\n",
        "eigenvalues, which are then used to determine the most important\n",
        "patterns or gradients in the data. These properties and applications of\n",
        "eigenvectors and eigenvalues will be covered in subsequent sections. The\n",
        "non-eigen approach instead uses numerical optimisation to find the best\n",
        "representation of the data in a lower-dimensional space.\n",
        "\n",
        "Below, I prefer a classification of the ordination methods into\n",
        "constrained and unconstrained methods. This classification is based on\n",
        "the type of information used to construct the ordination axes, and how\n",
        "they are used. Constrained methods use environmental data to construct\n",
        "the axes, while unconstrained methods do not. The main difference\n",
        "between these two classes is that constrained methods are\n",
        "hypothesis-driven, while unconstrained methods are exploratory.\n",
