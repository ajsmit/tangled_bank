### Assignment 1 Questions

> **Question 1:** Why is the matrix square, and what determines the number of rows/columns?
>
> **Question 2:** What is the meaning of the diagonal?
>
> **Question 3:** What is the meaning of the non-diagonal elements?
>
> **Question 4:** Take the data in row 1 and create a line graph that shows these values as a function of section number.
>
> **Question 5:** Provide a mechanistic (ecological) explanation for why this figure takes the shape that it does.

---

> **Question 6:** Why is there a difference between the two?
>
> **Question 7:** Which is correct?
>
> **Question 8:** Plot species turnover as a function of Section number, and provide a mechanistic exaplanation for the pattern observed.
>
> **Question 9:** Based on an assessment of literature on the topic, provide a discussion of nestedness-resultant Î²-diversity. Use either a marine or terrestrial example to explain this mode of structuring biodiversity.
