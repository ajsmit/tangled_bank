# Introduction to `R` Markdown in Quarto

## What Is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is designed for formatting text in a simple and readable way. It allows you to create formatted documents using a plain text editor, using symbols like `#` for headings, `*` or `-` for bullet lists, and other intuitive shortcuts. This makes it much easier to write well-structured documents compared to traditional word processors, especially for scientific and academic writing.

## `R` Markdown: Integrating Code and Text

`R` Markdown is an extension of Markdown that allows you to embed code --- such as `R`, Python, or Julia --- directly into your text. This means you can integrate both your narrative (your explanations, interpretation, and discussion) and your code (data analysis, statistics, plots) into a single document. When this document is rendered, both the text and the outputs of your code (including tables and figures) are combined together into a final report.

`R` Markdown is very useful in all areas of research because it allows you to:

- Write content in a human-readable format using Markdown
- Prepare transparent, reproducible reports
- Embed statistically detailed analyses directly alongside your commentary
- Easily incorporate tables, graphics, and other output generated by `R` into your document
- Write entire books or theses
- Even this website, Tangled Bank, was written entirely in `R` Markdown (in Quarto--see below)

## Using `R` Markdown in Quarto

Quarto is a modern open-source scientific and technical publishing system. It is essentially the successor to the older `R` Markdown system, and supports a range of programming languages in addition to `R`.

A basic `R` Markdown (as implemented in Quarto) document has three main elements:

1. **YAML Header:** At the very top, enclosed by three dashes `---`, specifying basic document metadata (such as title, author, output format). The YAML header is pedantic:
    - [it is **inclusive of the dashes**]{.my-highlight}
    - [entries there must be written **exactly as shown**]{.my-highlight}
    - [the **indents are precise** --- each deeper level in the hierarchy is marked by an additional two spaces]{.my-highlight}
    - [there may be **no blank lines** between entries]{.my-highlight}
2. **Narrative Text:** Written in Markdown, supporting headings, lists, emphasis, tables, and more
3. **Code Chunks:** Segments of code embedded in the narrative and enclosed using triple back ticks with curly braces indicating the language --- *e.g.* ```` ```{r} ```` at the start and ```` ``` ```` at the end of the chunk for `R` to insert tables, figures, and other outputs from an R analysis directly into your document

An example Quarto skeleton that shows these features could look like:

## Introduction

This study is about air quality.

## Methods

### Data

The dataset used in this study is the `airquality` dataset from R, which contains daily
air quality measurements in New York from May to September 1973. The dataset includes
variables such as ozone levels, solar radiation, wind speed, and temperature.

### Analysis

The R script in the code chunk further explores the impact of temperature on ozone level.
All analyses were done in R [@R2025].

This is **bold** text. This is *italicised* text.

```{{r}}
#| label: fig-airquality
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-cap-location: bottom
#| fig-cap: "Temperature and ozone level."
#| warning: false

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess")
```

## Results

The results show that air has quality (@fig-airquality).

Notes:

1. Lines 1-14: YAML header
2. Line 16: A level 2 header
3. Line 22: A level 3 header
4. Line 35-48: An R code chunk

In the above example, Lines 1-14 are called the YAML header, which contains metadata about the document. Initially, you'll not want to include the YAML lines `bibliography: ../references.bib` and `citation: true` since you will not have a bibliography file set up yet. The `citation: true` option is used to enable citations in the document, and you may read more about it elsewhere. [A very important part of the YAML header is the statement `embed-resources: true` which ensures that any images or other resources such as the theming styles etc. used in the document are embedded directly into the HTML output, making it self-contained and portable --- this is essential when you want to share your document with others, publish it online, or submit it for grading.]{.my-highlight}

Lines 16-33 are the first two sections (two level one headings, "Introduction" and "Methods", the latter with two level three headings beneath is, *i.e.*, "Data" and "Analysis") of the document.

Lines 35-48 make the code chunk, which is where we embed our `R` code. The `#| fig-cap` option in the code chunk specifies the caption for the figure that will be generated, and you can cross reference this from the body (see Line 52) text using `@fig-airquality`  --- this references the name specified by `#| label: fig-airquality`. The code chunk itself generates a figure that shows the relationship between temperature and ozone level in the `airquality` dataset. Notice also how I have cited a reference, `@R2025`, which is a reference to the `R` software itself, which is specified in the bibliography file `references.bib` (which you will need to create in your own time).

## For you to do:

1. Go to the RStudio menu and find 'File' > 'New File' > 'Quarto Document' and create your own Quarto file.
2. Save it using a descriptive name inside of your R Project directory.
3. Copy and paste the example skeleton into your own, fresh Quarto file.
4. Make a few edits to your taste, such as at least changing the author's name.
5. Render it (via the 'Render' button above the Code Editor).
:::

After you've rendered this file, you'll see the following output (the HTML output shown):

![The HTML output of the above Quarto document.](../../images/r_markdown_example.png){width="100%"}

### Supported output formats

By changing the `format` option in the YAML header, you can export your report to different types including:

- PDF documents (provided you have LaTeX installed)
- HTML web pages
- Word (.docx) documents

For example:
```yaml
format: pdf
```
or
```yaml
format: docx
```

### Rendering the document

- In RStudio or VS Code, you can click the **'Render'** or **'Knit'** button to produce your desired output.
- You can also use the command line: `$ quarto render my_file.qmd$`

## More Detailed Information

Please refer to the [Markdown Basics](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) page on the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) website for much more information about markdown.

Quarto is extremely powerful and you'll want to explore the Markdown Basics page thoroughly in your own time. Of immediate interest to most of you will be the page on [Citations](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/citations.html), or the other information under "Scholarly Writing" that you may access in the menu on the left of the page.

You will also have to explore the various YAML options, **YAML** meaning 'Yet Another Markup Language'. You can specify these at the beginning of your document in the YAML block at the top, which allows you to define various options for how your HTML, Word document, PDF, or any of the many formats that Quarto can produce, will look. Please consult the reference section on the Quarto website for the various YAML options available (*e.g.*, [here the HTML YAML options](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/html.html)), so that you can set up your document in the way you would like it to appear.

One thing to note about YAML is that it is incredibly particular about the way in which the various levels of indentation must appear in order for the YAML to be read correctly by your Quarto system and for the code to execute correctly. So, this is an excellent opportunity for you to pay attention to detail and ensure that your YAML is precisely structured according to the expectations of the example document provided.

## Why Use `R` Markdown?

- Ensures your analyses are **reproducible**
- Allows collaboration between researchers
- Combines field notes, data analysis, results, and interpretation in one place
