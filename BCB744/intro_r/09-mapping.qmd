Yesterday you learned how to create **ggplot2** figures, change their aesthetics, labels, colour palettes, and facet/arrange them. Now you are going to look at how to create maps. In maps, it helps to distinguish **fill** (area) from **colour** (line). Polygons and rasters are usually **filled**, while borders and paths are typically just **coloured** lines.

Most of the work that you will perform as environmental/biological scientists involves going out to a location and sampling information there. Sometimes only once, and sometimes over a period of time. All of these different sampling methods lend themselves to different types of figures. One of those, collection of data at different points, is best shown with maps. As you will see over the course of Day 3, creating maps in **ggplot2** is very straight forward, is extensively supported. For that reason you are going to have plenty of time to also learn how to do some more advanced things. Your goal in this chapter is to produce the figure below.

# Using Prepared Data

Before you begin let us go ahead and load the packages you will need, as well as the several dataframes required to make the final product.

```{r code-map-load}
# Load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(ggpubr)

# Load data
load(here::here("data", "BCB744", "south_africa_coast.Rdata"))
load(here::here("data", "BCB744", "sa_provinces.RData"))
load(here::here("data", "BCB744", "rast_annual.Rdata"))
load(here::here("data", "BCB744", "MUR.Rdata"))
load(here::here("data", "BCB744", "MUR_low_res.RData"))

# Choose which SST product you would like to use
sst <- MUR_low_res
# OR
sst <- MUR

# The colour palette we will use for ocean temperature
cols11 <- c("#004dcd", "#0068db", "#007ddb", "#008dcf", "#009bbc",
            "#00a7a9", "#1bb298", "#6cba8f", "#9ac290", "#bec99a")
```

# A New Concept?

The idea of creating a map in R may be daunting to some, but remember that a basic map is nothing more than a simple figure with an *x*, *y* axis. We tend to think of maps as different from other scientific figures, whereas in reality they are created the exact same way. The *epistemic* consequence of this is important: maps are built from the same grammar of graphics, but they carry extra assumptions about geography.

Before we move on, keep this distinction in mind:

-   **Data coordinates** are just numbers. They only become geographic when we interpret them as longitude and latitude.
-   **Geographic coordinates** imply scale, distance, and distortion. The moment we treat *x* and *y* as lon/lat, we accept projection‑related assumptions.

This is why `coord_equal()` is becomes important. It preserves a 1:1 relationship between units on the axes so the geometry is not subtly stretched.

Chicken dots:

```{r fig-map-point-1}
#| fig.cap: "Dot plot of chicken weight data."
ggplot(data = ChickWeight, aes(x = Time, y = weight)) +
  geom_point()
```

South African coast dots:

```{r fig-map-point-2}
#| fig.cap: "Dot plot off South African coast."
ggplot(data = south_africa_coast, aes(x = lon, y = lat)) +
  geom_point()
```

Does that look familiar? Notice how the *x* and *y* axis tick labels look the same as any map you would see in an atlas. This is because they are. But this is not a great way to create a map. Rather it is better to represent the land mass with a polygon. With **ggplot2** this is a simple task.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Checkpoint
Before scrolling, try swapping `lon` and `lat`. What happens to the coastline? This is a fast way to diagnose coordinate order mistakes.
:::

# Land Mask

Now that you have seen that a map is nothing more than a bunch of dots and shapes on specific points along the *x* and *y* axes you are going to look at the steps you would take to build a more complex map. Do not worry if this seems daunting at first. You are going to take this step by step and ensure that each step is made clear along the way. The first step is to create a polygon.

Why a polygon? Polygons encode **adjacency, continuity, and enclosure**  ---  properties that points cannot represent. This matters because land is not a collection of disconnected points; it is a continuous surface with a boundary (but this boundary does not *have* to correspond to geographical borders, although they can and often do).

Note that you create an aesthetic argument inside of `geom_polygon()` and not `ggplot()` because some of the steps you will take later on will not accept the `group` aesthetic. Remember, whatever aesthetic arguments we put inside of `ggplot()` will be inserted into all of our other `geom_...()` lines of code.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Why `group` Goes in `geom_polygon()`
Try moving `aes(group = group)` into the main `ggplot()` call. Later layers (*e.g.*, `geom_raster()`) will inherit it and may produce warnings or odd behaviour. Keeping `group` local to `geom_polygon()` makes the intent explicit and prevents accidental inheritance.
:::

```{r fig-map-polygon}
#| fig.cap: "Land mask of South Africa as a polygon."
ggplot(data = south_africa_coast, aes(x = lon, y = lat)) +
  geom_polygon(colour = "black", fill = "grey70", aes(group = group)) # The land mask
```

# Borders

The first thing you will add is the province borders as seen in Figure @fig-map-province. Notice how you only add one more line of code to do this.

```{r fig-map-province}
#| fig.cap: "South Africa with province borders added."
ggplot(data = south_africa_coast, aes(x = lon, y = lat)) +
  geom_polygon(colour = "black", fill = "grey70", aes(group = group)) +
  geom_path(data = sa_provinces, aes(group = group)) # The province borders
```

# Force lon/lat Extent

Unfortunately when you added our borders it increased the plotting area of our map past what you would like. To correct that you will need to explicitly state the borders you want. This is also where aspect ratio matters most: without `coord_equal()`, your coastline will be subtly stretched.

```{r fig-map-expand}
#| fig.cap: "The map, but with the extra bits snipped off."
ggplot(data = south_africa_coast, aes(x = lon, y = lat)) +
  geom_polygon(colour = "black", fill = "grey70", aes(group = group)) +
  geom_path(data = sa_provinces, aes(group = group)) + 
  coord_equal(xlim = c(15, 34), ylim = c(-36, -26), expand = 0) # Force lon/lat extent
```

# Ocean Temperature

This is starting to look pretty fancy, but it would be nicer if there was some colour involved. So let us add the ocean temperature. Again, this will only require one more line of code. Starting to see a pattern? But what is different this time, why? Here we are **filling** areas (ocean cells), not colouring borders, so we map to `fill` instead of `colour`.

```{r fig-map-mur}
#| fig.cap: "Ocean temperature (°C) visualised as an ice cream spill."
ggplot(data = south_africa_coast, aes(x = lon, y = lat)) +
  geom_raster(data = sst, aes(fill = bins)) + # The ocean temperatures
  geom_polygon(colour = "black", fill = "grey70", aes(group = group)) +
  geom_path(data = sa_provinces, aes(group = group)) +
  coord_equal(xlim = c(15, 34), ylim = c(-36, -26), expand = 0)
```

That looks... odd. Why do the colours look like someone melted a big bucket of ice cream in the ocean? This is because the colours you see in this figure are the default colours for discrete values in **ggplot2**. If you want to change them we may do so easily by adding yet one more line of code.

## Diagnostic Heuristic
If a continuous field looks blocky or cartoonish, check whether your variable has been discretised upstream. If it has, you will get a discrete palette and a stepped legend.
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Palette Consistency Is a Principle, Not a Quirk
**ggplot2** enforces a consistent palette across layers so that the same colour always means the same thing. This is a principle of perceptual coherence, not just a package rule.
:::

```{r fig-map-colour}
#| fig.cap: "Ocean temperatures (°C) around South Africa."
ggplot(data = south_africa_coast, aes(x = lon, y = lat)) +
  geom_raster(data = sst, aes(fill = bins)) +
  geom_polygon(colour = "black", fill = "grey70", aes(group = group)) +
  geom_path(data = sa_provinces, aes(group = group)) +
  scale_fill_manual("Temp. (°C)", values = cols11) + # Set the colour palette
  coord_equal(xlim = c(15, 34), ylim = c(-36, -26), expand = 0)
```

There is a colour palette that would make Jacques Cousteau swoon. When you set the **fill** palette for a figure in **ggplot2** you must use that fill palette for all other instances of those types of values, too. What this means is that any other discrete values that will be filled in, like the ocean cells above, must use the same fill palette (there are some technical exceptions to this rule that you will not cover in this course). You normally want **ggplot2** to use consistent palettes anyway, but it is important to note that this constraint exists. Let us see what I mean. Next you will add the coastal pixels to our figure with one more line of code. You will not change anything else. Note how **ggplot2** changes the fill of the coastal pixels to match the ocean fill automatically.

```{r fig-map-raster}
#| fig.cap: "Map of South Africa showing *in situ* temperatures (°C) as pixels along the coast."
ggplot(data = south_africa_coast, aes(x = lon, y = lat)) +
  geom_raster(data = sst, aes(fill = bins)) +
  geom_polygon(colour = "black", fill = "grey70", aes(group = group)) +
  geom_path(data = sa_provinces, aes(group = group)) +
  geom_tile(data = rast_annual, aes(x = lon, y = lat, fill = bins), 
            colour = "white", size = 0.1) + # The coastal temperature values
  scale_fill_manual("Temp. (°C)", values = cols11) +
  coord_equal(xlim = c(15, 34), ylim = c(-36, -26), expand = 0)
```

# Final Touches

You used `geom_tile()` instead of `geom_rast()` to add the coastal pixels above so that you could add those little white boxes around them.

Why tiles? `geom_tile()` and `geom_raster()` are best for **gridded data** (continuous fields sampled on a grid). Points are best for **discrete observations**. Choosing the geometry tells the reader what kind of data you believe you have.

This figure is looking pretty great now. And it only took a few rows of code to put it all together! The last step is to add several more lines of code that will control for all of the little things you want to change about the appearance of the figure. Each little thing that is changed below is annotated for your convenience.

## Design Choices Are Not Defaults
Adding borders, grids, or labels is a rhetorical decision. Ask yourself: does this layer help the scientific story, or just add clutter?
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Failure Modes to Watch For
-   **Swapped lon/lat** → the map appears mirrored or rotated.
-   **No `coord_equal()`** → coastlines look stretched.
-   **Mismatched extents** → rasters appear shifted or cropped.

## Workflow Tip
Build the map in this order: data → geometry → scale → coordinate system → theme. Styling comes last.
:::

```{r fig-map-final}
#| fig.cap: "The cleaned up map of South Africa. Resplendent with coastal and ocean temperatures (°C)."
final_map <- ggplot(data = south_africa_coast, aes(x = lon, y = lat)) +
  geom_raster(data = sst, aes(fill = bins)) +
  geom_polygon(colour = "black", fill = "grey70", aes(group = group)) +
  geom_path(data = sa_provinces, aes(group = group)) +
  geom_tile(data = rast_annual, aes(x = lon, y = lat, fill = bins), 
            colour = "white", size = 0.1) +
  scale_fill_manual("Temp. (°C)", values = cols11) +
  coord_equal(xlim = c(15, 34), ylim = c(-36, -26), expand = 0) +
  scale_x_continuous(position = "top") + # Put x axis labels on top of figure
  theme(axis.title = element_blank(), # Remove the axis labels
        legend.text = element_text(size = 7), # Change text size in legend
        legend.title = element_text(size = 7), # Change legend title text size
        legend.key.height = unit(0.3, "cm"), # Change size of legend
        legend.background = element_rect(colour = "white"), # Add legend background
        legend.justification = c(1, 0), # Change position of legend
        legend.position = c(0.55, 0.4) # Fine tune position of legend
        )
final_map
```

That is a very clean looking map so go ahead and save it on your local disk.

```{r code-map-save, eval=FALSE}
ggsave(plot = final_map, "figures/map_complete.pdf", height = 6, width = 9)
```
