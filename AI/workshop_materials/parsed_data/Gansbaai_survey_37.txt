Recently joined a co-op

# Does the nature of the local economy (the kind of place this is) matter to how you earn your income?
5

# Please explain your answer above.
Dependent on the sea. Sometimes we travel to other places, only when there is an opportunity to catch fish, but this is home.

# What worries you about the future in terms of the weather or climate in this location? Please explain.
The weather is changing and getting worse over time, this worries me.

# What limits or constrains your income here ‚Äì how could you earn more? Please explain
The laws and regulations around fishing are what constrain my income the most. The co-operatives don't benefit, we still need permits to get fish anyways so there are no advantages of being a part of the co-op. The permits were consolidated for the co-op, and so individuals have lost the power to catch fish alone. So one guy will go out, catch crayfish, then we pay him a commission fee, and then also profit from his catch. But basically, we can't fish individually. 

Restricted access - with current developments, we cannot get to the sites we used to access for fishing. They want to exclude people from walking on the beach because they want to build private housing estates, but we depend on these coasts for our livelihoods and resources. Huge issues around access and benefit sharing. 


# What are the other things do you worry about in this location that can affect your income?
The weather. The change of permit conditions from number of crayfish to tonnage. The co-op applies for a permit, then we appoint a representative. He catches the fish, and then we proportionally divide the profits (we all have an equal share as we are listed on the co-op permit). We need this anyways, because we don't have boats or bakkies, and equipment to catch fish. But we lose a lot of money in fees since we have to go this route. Sometimes, the permit quota is also not met, and then we all have lesser profits. 

We are just names on a list, we are used for the permits. Sometimes the broker won't even tell us what they've caught, and we just have to take their word for it - so they could have harvested kelp and we just don't know. Maybe they are keeping the profits for themselves. 


# Unnamed: 21


# How do you fish?
Small scale motor boat, Small scale rowing boat, Ski boats

# What type of fish (species) do you target / handle?
Line fish (snoek, yellowtail, steentjies, roman etc)?, Harders, Lobster/crayfish?, Molluscs (mussels, perlemoen aulikreukel, limpids)?, Has seaweed rights as part of co-op

# What type of gear do you use?
Handline, RIng nets

# What do you do with your catch?
There is a minimum number of fish we need to catch before we can take any home.

# Maak jy jou vangs skoon en verwerk jy dit?
I only clean the fish I take home.

# As die vangs skoongemaak of verwerk is, hoe doen jy dit?
Vlek it and eat/use/sell it fresh

# Do your fishing habits or decisions depend on the what kind  of season you experience (e.g. windier, colder water etc,?).
4

# Please explain your answer above
"You get your winter in the summer".

# Any other information about your fish related livelihood or activities that you can share?
One day they say the snoek is 100 ZAR. The next day it is 60 ZAR. The price changes depending on the quota caught, and it's been underfished and we are not able to make a living. The price is variable and this is stressful. I suggest that there should be a fixed price.

# Please add any notes or observations regarding any of the changes above. What do you think has caused these changes?
The NW is the most dangerous wind here. Fish move away, and it is harder to access the sea. This is what happens with the increasing strength of the currents too. 

Cooler water temperatures: Fish don't come towards the shore anymore, the fish don't bite as much, so we catch less. It is better for us when the warm water comes in shore, as fish bite more. 10-13 degrees is optimum for us. 

Storms: Sometimes we go out into the harbour and just turn around because the weather is so bad. 

Distribution of fish has changed with these changing conditions, less predictable. 

Seals: The seals are taking the fish off the line (snoek and hottentot). There used to be a quota for the seals in the old days, but no more. Completely black from the seal boom - way too many seals.

# If you think these changes are a problem - how should they be addressed / fixed and by whom?
I think there is a cascading impact of oil drilling - the drilling is limiting the fish we catch and changing the distribution. The drilling needs to stop. They are polluting the bay. 

Snoek trawlers, big farms (I&J) are trawling the linefish, they are coming closer and closer inshore and limiting our catch. 

Permit issue: The concessions are bullshit - we get issues a permit to catch sardines so the government can say "look , we're taking care of you," but in reality, the permit allows us to only catch sardines by handline, which isn't possible. 

The co-op system is not working and we should scrap it. The management and systemic restriction is. What is is limiting us is not the lack of fish and the weather, it is the systemic failure of management. The people that have the money to buy the boat (we cant), are then making all the money. So the money stays with the rich, we don't get benefits from this system. We need infrastructure and equipment (boat, bakkie, permit). We would prefer individual permits rather than the co-op system. Yet, I would sign up for the co-op again, we just need better leadership that doesn't screw us over. We were promised things, none of these promises have been delivered upon. The co-ops were created to redistribute the fishing rights after 2017, but we are screwed anyways. It has made no difference to us, because we are still too dependent on others to make a living, and after the commissions and price variability, we are left with nothing, as was previously true.

# Do you have any other observations or thoughts about this questionnaire or the topics discussed, that you would like to share?
Many poachers coming in from Gansbaai and Hermanus, now poaching here in Paternoster. But we stay away from them, not worth the fights.
