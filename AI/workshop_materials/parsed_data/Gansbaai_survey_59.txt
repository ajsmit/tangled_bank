# Does the nature of the local economy (the kind of place this is) matter to how you earn your income?
5

# Please explain your answer above.
Small scale fishers work in nearshore areas - need abundant inshore areas in order to fish.

# What worries you about the future in terms of the weather or climate in this location? Please explain.
Rough seas in winter - fewer sea days in winter now compared to the past. Winter season feels longer. Northerly winds make it difficult to fish in small boats.

# What limits or constrains your income here ‚Äì how could you earn more? Please explain
Government policies and permitting - this needs to change to get a stable income. Permits allow them to collect seaweed (when they cannot go to sea) that they do not get here. Only one person has the permit to commercially harvest E. maxima which is found here.

# What are the other things do you worry about in this location that can affect your income?
Zonations - their zone ranges from Saldhana Bay to Velddrift - but quite a lotof this area is actually restricted and they cannot collect crayfish - this results in a very limited fishing area.

# Unnamed: 21

# Do your fishing habits or decisions depend on the what kind  of season you experience (e.g. windier, colder water etc,?).
5

# Please explain your answer above


# Any other information about your fish related livelihood or activities that you can share?
Town is becoming more touristy - tourists and holidaymakers dont approve of the historical fishing culture of the town.

# Please add any notes or observations regarding any of the changes above. What do you think has caused these changes?
Costs are very high and income is very low comparatively - increasingly becoming less viable. Also because of the quotas - cannot catch as much as before. Fishermen are turning to poaching which will have a negative effect on the natural stocks. Taking money from the fishermen and it's being put towards poaching. When wind is blowing from north this increases water temps - this correlated with crayfish dying in the tanks. Fish stocks have not changed - the only change has been number of sea days.

# If you think these changes are a problem - how should they be addressed / fixed and by whom?
Community-led action in collaboration with government would fix the issues surrounding permitting and poaching and the low catch quotas. More engagement with DFFE on a community-level. There is no feedback from the department - they are not playing the supportive role that the community needs. Scientists that collect data should use local, traditional knowledge for their surveys and research. Financial support from government - they wanted the community to start co-ops but didn't give any financial support to do this - to improve/develop processing facilities or buy bigger boats. Increasing catch quotas would help as the current ones are unrealistic. Young people - incentivising and training young people in these traditional fishing communities in ecotourism or fishing etc so they have a future as fishing is becoming less and less viable.

# Do you have any other observations or thoughts about this questionnaire or the topics discussed, that you would like to share?
