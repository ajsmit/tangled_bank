# Please explain your answer above.
Winter time is very hard for us. Men can't go to sea, builders can't work. It's actually a very poor place.

# What worries you about the future in terms of the weather or climate in this location? Please explain.
Storms and winter weather is getting worse. I worry that it's going to get much worse in coming years.

# What limits or constrains your income here ‚Äì how could you earn more? Please explain
We don't have our own equipment (boats, trucks etc.). If we had our own equipment, we could own more. We need to reply on other people's machinery and trucks and pay them as well. The boats are not as important, but the trasnport/trucks are needed. We can apply to the government for this but we are a new co-op and there is still a lot to learn.

# What are the other things do you worry about in this location that can affect your income?
I worry that the permits will expire and we will not be finished. A huge problem herre is the youth, they just don't have worrk here and there isn't much work for them at all. Drugs, alcohol is rampant. No jobs avaiable, motivation to study is not there.

# Please add any notes or observations regarding how any of the above impacts on your ability to earn an income.


# If you think these changes are a problem - how should they be addressed / fixed and by whom?
The government should make the official crayfish season longer. Rather than it ending in March, it should be extended till May to account for wreather changes. The kelp permits need to be renewed every year, we need to apply every year for renewal. Why doesn't the government just give us a straighforward permit so we don't need to re-apply every year? Maybe 3-4 years.

# Do you have any other observations or thoughts about this questionnaire or the topics discussed, that you would like to share?
