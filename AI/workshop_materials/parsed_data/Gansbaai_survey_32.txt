We're set up to feed off shark diving activity, but with the change in shark activity and shark presence, there have been some concerns in terms of tourism.

The area is very well known for tourism thanks to the whale watching, shark diving etc. Gansbaai hasn't hut its peak yet and with the infrastructure developments, we hope things will come ,ore accessible for people and boost business even more.

# Please add any notes or observations regarding how any of the above impacts on your ability to earn an income.
Crocodiles go into hibernation and it is weather dependent, so we need to plan out dives according to the weather conditions. We need to bring in heating lights to keep up with the drops in temperature since they are not used to being this far south. With the temperatures dropping so much, we see the crocs in the water a lot more since it's warmer inside than outside. Similar with the wind chill factor. 

The losses experienced are not direct but a cascading effect from shark tourism, activity. Can work both ways - less tourists but also sometime we act as a replacement for adrenaline junkies. So can also work in our favour.

# If you think these changes are a problem - how should they be addressed / fixed and by whom?


# Do you have any other observations or thoughts about this questionnaire or the topics discussed, that you would like to share?
