# Please add any notes or observations regarding any of the changes above. What do you think has caused these changes?
If the water is stronger they tend to be better catches. Fish are more available. Some changes - 15-18 was normal now catching in colder water. Pattern change in fish behaviour or preference. Seeing abnormality in warm water patches - getting used to it. The ecosystem is ondersteoor - seismic surveys are chasing fish away. No fish inshore as before- blames it on the seismic work here. Last two years are worse. Pattern of 7 years good then three bad. Red tide is a big deal - two kinds - related to the river.  Seen Pike (>20tons) never seen before. Seals have really become a problem.
