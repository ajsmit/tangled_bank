# What species of animal / plant do you farm?
Abalone

# Are you living here because of the farming or are you farming because you live here?
Moved here for the job.

# What are the advantages of farming in this location?
The bay - ocean conditions in terms of kelp forests (natural environment for the abalone) - eg West coast suffers from red tides alot so have to close.

# What are the disadvantages of farming in this location?
Storms make it hard to operate but not impossible. Far from airport - export purposes and trucks are targets for hijacking. Poaching, needs high security.

# What are the biggest natural risks to your farming?
Extreme marine heatwaves - anything above 22degC is detrimental for abalone. Red tides and algal blooms of toxic species. Not possible to cool water

# Is daar enige seisoenale gevolge waaroor jy bekommerd is? (Is sommige seisoene erger as ander? Is sommige jare erger as ander?)
Yes definitely varies year to year / season to season

# If you answered yes above, please explain.
Animals grow in winter during stable temps but South Easter wind and upwelling result in highly variable temperatures and slower growth rates. However income is not affected due to diverse range of products - live abalone, canned, dried and frozen.

# What are the other risks and constraints to your farming?
Industrial action affecting wage workers. Electricity supply and cost - uses hybrid system to combat but still partially on the grid.

# What changes to environmental conditions or trends have you noticed in the last 5 years? (Good or bad!).
Alot of storms - extremes are intensifying. MHWs happening once or twice per year but are becoming more intense and longer?

Extreme thermal events, extreme storms - flooding and reducing quality of water in bay. Red tides. Last two years have been particularly bad.

# If you think these changes are a problem - how should they be addressed / fixed and by whom?
Water quality - spilling from red tide, fish factories, oil spills, sewage etc - not a problem yet but could be. temperature - global thing so we have to adapt eg adapt animals genetic line to make them more resilient to temp fluctuations. Also adapting the handling methods with temperature. Salinity potential problem on the horizon - however can be controlled within the system. Filters we used to diminish water quality issues.can switch pumps off for about a week during periods of low water quality.

# Do you have any other observations or thoughts about this questionnaire or the topics discussed, that you would like to share?
