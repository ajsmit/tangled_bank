# Please add any notes or observations regarding how any of the above impacts on your ability to earn an income.
Production figures have definitely dropped - pilchards and anchovies have been bad and it became problematic for a long time as they were urged to slow down. Pilchards populations are slowly rising again and good now. Line fisherman also impacted by the seals.

# If you think these changes are a problem - how should they be addressed / fixed and by whom?
No control over seals but recommended culling and that it provides job creation. We can't do anything about the weather.

# Do you have any other observations or thoughts about this questionnaire or the topics discussed, that you would like to share?
MPA closures affected them a lot. It very much affected the areas that they can catch and they are unable to do anything about it.
