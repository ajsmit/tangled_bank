Climate is changing, lots more NE storms, Fisherman prefer West, SW westher, but this is changing. In the summer there is more East weather as opposed to South and SE weather (which is preferred in the summer). The nature of the SE is also changing - it doesn't bring the yellowtail into shore as it once did.

The weather does not allow us to go to sea - storms carrying on much longer than usual. Almlst 2 months without going to sea, very contraining. Water is too colder was fishing - water should be at least 15-16 degrees, but currently the water is 14 degrees and nothing wants to bite (not an ideal temperature for fishing).

Non of the above (someone else processes it)

5

# Please explain your answer above
Every fish has its season. Say it's JFM, you catch cobs. Then they move up to Arniston, Stilbaai. We need the right weather and tthe right currents, the season matters by area.

# Please add any notes or observations regarding any of the changes above. What do you think has caused these changes?
Temperature: Water temp is getting colder. 

Changes in fish species: barracuda/scotsman in Struisbaai (not supposed to be there) 

Seals: Seal population is exponentially increasing. Seals are taking out the penguins, the seal will rip out its throat/food pipe and then leaves the penguin. Seals population boom is contributing to penguin population decline. Scientists are not doing anythign about it, no population control like the way it is done on land. Seals eat 1/3rd of it‚Äôs weight per day ‚Äî not enough fish. Seals are a very big problems. At night, 100s of seals in the pelagic fish catching nets. 

Fish species: Fish are less, but more sharks (due to stopping the longliners)

# Please add any notes or observations regarding how any of the above impacts on your ability to earn an income.
Strong winds and wind direction changes: less sea days 
Strong current: Agulhas current going away from sure in the summer 
Rain: Lots of rain this year, all the freshwater was running down to the ocean, affected income negatively. 
More or less fish or harvested species: The fish is there, lots of yellowtail, but the fish wouldn't bite because water rtemperature is way too cold.

# If you think these changes are a problem - how should they be addressed / fixed and by whom?
There's only one guy to fix this, and he's up there. We're playing a part with the factories and pollution but it's in his hands, not ours. Government regulations won't make a difference, but maybe if they can do something about the seal populations - that would help. And perhaps regulations on bottom trawlers - put observers onto boats and see.

# Do you have any other observations or thoughts about this questionnaire or the topics discussed, that you would like to share?
Seasonal Shark fishing ‚Äî> Somerset West where it is filleted ‚Äî> sent to Australia (meat is processed) then sent to Italy/Spain  Sharks only caught in April, May, beginnbing of June   Don‚Äôt catch sharks over 12 kgs, no money, rather let them reproduce.   Galjeon ‚Äî> fishes for himself from rocks and then trades with friends (not allowed to sell as it is the national fish) ‚Äî> Galjeon is a very tirkcy fish to catch, I‚Äôve learnt this through generations, from my grandfather and great grandfather. Not everyone catches Galjeon.  Water temp is getting colder   Changes in fish species: barracuda/scotsman in Struisbaai (not supposed to be there)   Seals: Seal population is exponentially increasing ‚Äî> seals are taking out the penguins, the seal will rip out its throat/food pipe and then leaves the penguin. Seals population boom is contributing to penguin population decline. Scientists are not doing anythign about it, no population control like the way it is done on land. Seals eat 1/3rd of it‚Äôs weight per day ‚Äî not enough fish.   ‚ÄúThe biggest problem for fishing is mid-water and bottom trawling. They catch so much snoek that they aren‚Äôt supposed to. But there is nothing we can do about it.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhen you catch fish with a handline, if it doesn‚Äôt want to bite, it‚Äôs not biting. When you catch it with a net, it‚Äôs caught. But yet, in the whole of South Africa the handline fishers are the only ones that are limited to a acertain area to fish. The people that are doing the least harm have the most regulations. The longliners and trawlers can go anywhere they want, and they are just doing the most damage‚Ä¶‚Äù
