5

# Please explain your answer above.


# What worries you about the future in terms of the weather or climate in this location? Please explain.
Climate change is really a problem. The weather patterns are changing all the time. It prevents us from going to sea.

# What limits or constrains your income here ‚Äì how could you earn more? Please explain
When the basket of species system was established, we could not freely fish anymore. Our income is now dependent on this, and this restrains us as compared to when we had personal permits. When the apartheid government was in power, I had better living conditions than I do now. Being part of a co-operative has actually restrained us. There are now service providers and there is no personal relationship to the small-scale fishers. Even though I am board member, I have been sidelined. Only 3 people run the whole co-op and the benefits do not trickle down to us. 

How could you live with 13 kg of crayfish and kelp? We don't even know how many tons of kelp allowance we were given. 

This system has pushed us back and we are worse off than we have to be. And I blame DAFF for it. Also the MLRA should have been reviewed ages ago, but this Act has not been reviewed and it doesn't include any human rights for us to go out to sea. 

I have a boat, but I have no license to go to sea. The allocations are so limited, and the commercial sector takes everything. Even with the commercial permit allocated to our co-op, the co-op leaders decide who gets licenses and they didn't pick me. DFFE is captured and controlled by the commercial entities.

# What are the other things do you worry about in this location that can affect your income?
I am worried about my children's future in terms of the small scale fisheries. If I can't survive, how will they survive. This is a fishing village, this is the only industry we have. And we can't survive on it.

# Unnamed: 21


# How do you fish?
Small scale motor boat

# What type of fish (species) do you target / handle?
Line fish (snoek, yellowtail, steentjies, roman etc)?, Lobster/crayfish?

# What type of gear do you use?
Handline

# What do you do with your catch?
Sell all of it

# Maak jy jou vangs skoon en verwerk jy dit?
No, I leave it as is (to sell or pass on).

# As die vangs skoongemaak of verwerk is, hoe doen jy dit?
Vlek it and eat/use/sell it fresh

# Do your fishing habits or decisions depend on the what kind  of season you experience (e.g. windier, colder water etc,?).
5

# Please explain your answer above
I sell my fish to the brokers (langanas). 

All our fishing decisions depend on the sea days. We have to rely on the weather, if we can;t get out, that's what it is.

# Please add any notes or observations regarding any of the changes above. What do you think has caused these changes?
Mostly the winds come from N, NW, SSE. This (NW, SSE) is the worst sort of wind as it affects the harbours. Now you can't get out to sea, you can barely even walk along the beach. The wind is coming more on-shore than before. The water levels are also rising, and the water level is higher than the quay so we can't launch. 

Currents: we need to use more weight on the line to keep it stable, and we can't feel the fish biting because the current is so strong sometimes. 

Water temp: warmer than before. So the fish don't come to shore. We can only fish 
in shore as handline guys. The cape bream is affected too as the water gets warmer 

Red tide: it happens less than before, but rarely has an effect. Especially not in shore. Maybe this is because there is just no fish in shore for it to have an effect on. 

Pollution: when the oil tankers are around, we experience more pollution. 

Seals: You can't catch fish when the seals are around. 15 seals to one boat, they are eating more fish than we do. DFFE needs to make a plan to control the seals. There's just more and more of them everyday..

# If you think these changes are a problem - how should they be addressed / fixed and by whom?
DFFE or the Courts needs to fix them. The government needs to give us our aboriginal/traditional fishing rights back so that we can fish without permits as it is our livelihood and history, or ensure that the co-op is able to distribute the permits/licenses fairly so that everyone benefits from the co-op, not just the ones who are in control. Noone acknowledges are complaints, no one answers our calls. 

If there could be an authority/representative we could go to, to complain, this would make for a better environment. We are so poor, we have no other choice, and noone listens to us. The socio-economic conditions now are worse than in the apartheid regime. How is this social justice --> equity problem.

# Do you have any other observations or thoughts about this questionnaire or the topics discussed, that you would like to share?
