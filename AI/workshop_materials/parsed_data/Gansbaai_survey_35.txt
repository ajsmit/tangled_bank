# Does the weather / kind of season (e.g. windy, dry etc) make a difference to your livelihood?
2

# Do you belong to any association or organization related to your jobs/source of income?
none

# Does the nature of the local economy (the kind of place this is) matter to how you earn your income?
1

# Please explain your answer above.
Could earn this income anywhere along the coast. However the community of St Helena Bay is underpinned and supported by the fishing industry.

# What worries you about the future in terms of the weather or climate in this location? Please explain.
Not necessarily the weather - but the small scale co op that has been set up recently (gives people permits) - they enforce the permits and control the fishing community - Gerard does not belong to it and wants to join but  they will not allow him - they block him by giving him wrong dates for meetings etc. These co ops are not inclusive and are bringing down the community

# What limits or constrains your income here ‚Äì how could you earn more? Please explain
The cooperatives open permit applications to all SA citizens not just to fisherman - people who‚Äôs livelihoods depend on fishing do not have access to permits as more wealthy people can buy up the permits. When these fisherman go fishing for their own to feed themselves - they get caught without a permit and fined a lot of money (eg R5000 for 10 mullets). 400-500 fisherman in the western cape who suffer from this, Gerard himself is very close to being homeless. This small area has been split in to 4 different cooperatives - affects fish sales etc. He last earned money from the sea in May.

# What are the other things do you worry about in this location that can affect your income?
Co-ops and government encourages fisherman here to harvest kelp to sell to abalone farms. - however from ysterfontein to velddrif you cannot harvest kelp - only one person has this permit. 
Sense of community and kindness has been lost because of the politics of the co-ops. Gerard wants to go to sea and fish and make a living out of this. But without the permits himself and other fisherman are resorting to poaching and theft to sustain themselves.

# Unnamed: 21


# How do you fish?
Small scale motor boat, He had to sell his boat last year February (as soon as co-op was established) because he couldnt afford it. He bought it three months earlier for over R30,000 and could only sell it for R10,000.

# What type of fish (species) do you target / handle?
Pelagics (horse mackerel, sardinella, tuna)?, Line fish (snoek, yellowtail, steentjies, roman etc)?, Lobster/crayfish?, mainly snoek.

# What type of gear do you use?
Longline, Cannot fish anymore due to no permit.

# What do you do with your catch?
Eat some and sell some

does not do this anymore

# Please add any notes or observations regarding any of the changes above. What do you think has caused these changes?
- The bad weather eg winds is required to bring in the fish. No wind = no fish. This year there has been more wind and rain. August is the windiest month usually - with two weeks of wind and rain - this signal the start of a good fishing season but this year they have not had that constant 14 days of wind and rain. Big red tides cause crayfish walkouts eg in Elandsbaai nearby. Freshwater runoff has actually decreased recently - Gerard believes that this greatly affects fish (the fish needs the rain).

# Please add any notes or observations regarding how any of the above impacts on your ability to earn an income.
Permitting and the co-ops have the biggest effect on Gerard's ability to earn an income. He would welcome the weather being the main block but unfortunately it isn't.

# If you think these changes are a problem - how should they be addressed / fixed and by whom?
The government is the only body that can fix this situation by changing the way the co-operatives are structured and the permitting process.

# Do you have any other observations or thoughts about this questionnaire or the topics discussed, that you would like to share?
