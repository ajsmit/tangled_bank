Access to land, relatively close to airport infrastructure.

Prevalence of ambulates on the side of the coast seem to be more than in other parts of the country. Abalone is susceptible to red tide which we didn't know at the time.

# What are the biggest natural risks to your farming?
Red tides, pollution from shipwrecks. Oil spills from ships - not very common, but is a potential threat nonetheless.

Yes definitely varies year to year / season to season

Autumn has the most prevalence of red tides. Sometimes in the summer the SE drops for a significant period, and this changes the water temperature.

# What are the other risks and constraints to your farming?


# What changes to environmental conditions or trends have you noticed in the last 5 years? (Good or bad!).
Species and time periods are just different - can't say if it's worse or better, but it is changing. 5 years have all been different, but can't say if there's really a trend. We experienced an 8 week period where we saw a specific dinoflagellate, but can't really say if this is a permanent shift or not.
