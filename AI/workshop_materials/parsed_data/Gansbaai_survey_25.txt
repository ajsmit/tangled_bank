Moved here for a better quality of life, not necessarily for the shell collecting or because it is Pearly Beach.

Yes worried because people are not working and the sea is fighting. There are a lot of waves and people cannot go out to sea.

Abalone rights - more abalone harvesting means more abalone shells to collect and sell because these are much more in demand.

No jobs in general - people are suffering. I don't want to collect shells because I'm hungry and have no other source of money. I want to collect shells in my own spare time because I want to.
