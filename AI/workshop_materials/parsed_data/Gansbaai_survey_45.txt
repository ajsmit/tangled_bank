# Please explain your answer above.
Velddrif is a big birding and fishing hotspot.

# What worries you about the future in terms of the weather or climate in this location? Please explain.
Yes - getting drier and the natural vegetation is dying. Might also have something to do with the dams being built further up the river. Water becomes very saline after the dams - having more 1 in 100years floods - more flamingos now after the floods. Pelicans do not return due to the dry conditions a few years back. Directly impacts business.

# What limits or constrains your income here ‚Äì how could you earn more? Please explain
Better weather conditions. Ideally cold and wet in winter and hot and dry in summer. More regulations around poaching. River rangers that patrol the river for poachers but cannot take action - police also dont do anything because a few are poachers themselves. Two nights ago there were poachers. Poachers who cannot catch fish end up burgling local houses.

# What are the other things do you worry about in this location that can affect your income?
Advertising town more.

# Please add any notes or observations regarding any of the changes above. What do you think has caused these changes?
December wind as decreased - however this means the transvaal doesnt get rain. Wind direction - more easterly winds and westerly winds in winter. This change in winds will disrupt how the fish move in the river which could impact numbers of guests. River water temps are warmer and saltier. More northwesterly storms - heavy thunder that knocks out electricity - there never used to be thunderstorms. New species - river water so saline in recent years because of dry conditions that crayfish and solefish have been found in the river. Litter washes in from ocean with the tide and from locals littering from boats - litter gets trapped in wetland. If the water stays salty and warm then the fish do not come into the river - may affect number of guests. Guests love the seals - positively impacts.

# Please add any notes or observations regarding how any of the above impacts on your ability to earn an income.
Poachers are a big problem - poaching mullet and then lots of bycatch, but then the bycatch is completely discarded. The government needs to do something about this - people are passionate about sorting out the poaching problem but the givernment regulations get in the way. It is also a safety issue - because the poachers are shooting seals and there could always be a rogue bullet. 

Veldriftt local economy matters a lot, birding and fishing hot spot. 

The weather is getting drier, and only in the last two years have we had proper winter floods to clean out the saline run off upstream. One year the pelicans didn‚Äôt return because of the drought.

# If you think these changes are a problem - how should they be addressed / fixed and by whom?
Government very disconnected from the problems of locals. Poaching is the biggest problem - safety risk too as they poach with guns to shoot seals that come for their nets.

# Do you have any other observations or thoughts about this questionnaire or the topics discussed, that you would like to share?
