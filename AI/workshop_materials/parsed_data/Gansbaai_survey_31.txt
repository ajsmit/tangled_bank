5

# Please explain your answer above
Been out of fresh local fish for about two months now - very few sea days. Tuna and norwegian salmon - get from Cape Town and Gordons Bay in December (this is the supplier of non-local seafood). Not really much of a market here for it though - people don‚Äôt know how to cook this fish.

# Any other information about your fish related livelihood or activities that you can share?
Fishing is definitely deteriorating. Used to be a lot of cob, red fish and cape salmon - it is not extinct - times of year they arrive are just changing. Fish looks like it's getting less and less every year - eg the pilchards are now coming from PE. Off record: Very worried about the state of the ocean and overfishing and unregulated catches. No people here in gansbaai and the future is looking bleak.

# Please add any notes or observations regarding any of the changes above. What do you think has caused these changes?
Storms become more vicious and seasons are moving - colder weather and storms starting later than before. Seasonality more intense - winter frost this year. Hasn't noticed red tides much - attributes it to runoff.  Nurdles biggest issue in terms of pollution. The 74 - pink fish with dark stripe - overfished to point of near-extinction but now it is coming back. Dageraat - red bank fish that disappeared for a long time is also making a reappearance. Yellowbelly rock cod also making reappearance. Also catching red roman from shore - all these re emerging fish are coming from the sanctuary at De Hoop. Big problem with seals currently - feeding on penguins.

Working day-to-day. Winter is getting longer and more intense - not good for fishing and fish stocks. Overfishing has also made a big impact on current fish stocks.

Everybody should address these problems by playing by the rules and regulations - don't litter/ fish undersized fish/ catch more fish than you should etc. Keep our oceans cleaner.
