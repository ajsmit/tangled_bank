# Please explain your answer above.
Would move somewhere else there is an ocean, but obviously based and dependant on St Helena.

# What worries you about the future in terms of the weather or climate in this location? Please explain.
Changes in wind have changed the times to catch most fish - used to come in after N winds but now come with S. They are seeing less fish inshore, leading to higher petrol expenses, and strongly correlate it to the tankers in the area.

# What limits or constrains your income here ‚Äì how could you earn more? Please explain
Working for other people means they get less % profit per catch. Can only get rich if you have your own boat, although that comes with it's own expenses.

# What are the other things do you worry about in this location that can affect your income?
Trawlers getting bycatch, and changing in trawling habits are conflicting with their practices. They catch the fishermen's snoek too, and fish in areas where they shouldn't, even if they are only licensed for tuna only, for example. They come inshore even though the license doesn't allow it. People can now fish on boats day and night (overnight) which causes them to catch more, and they scare the fish off/cause them to move. These people definitely earn more than they do. These people are basically mini factory ships that can store fish on site and collect way more

Vlek it and eat/use/sell it fresh, Non of the above (someone else processes it), Grill/fry personal use fish at home

# Please add any notes or observations regarding any of the changes above. What do you think has caused these changes?
Strong winds have caused boats to overturn and caused fatalities! Standards have improved since SAMSA. One main terrible red tide event but they seem to have decreased overall. Pollution impacts from factories seen closer to shore/in the harbour. More seals, problems with catching their fish or chasing them away. Less fish in the area to catch, too!

# Please add any notes or observations regarding how any of the above impacts on your ability to earn an income.
Stronger currents means more difficult to catch fish. Different temp fluctuations to other areas nearby. Concern about what the ships are in the area are doing to the water, and the drilling nearby.

# If you think these changes are a problem - how should they be addressed / fixed and by whom?
Government - better regulations on industrial fleets and regulate them so they have less impact, monitoring the trawlers. They're making decisions that don't make sense or correlate to the individual sea person's life and job. Unfair approvals for applications to the co-op (some that deserve it don't get accepted, but others not deserving do). The small man is being screwed over! References to corruption. Members of the co-op are not getting the benefits, but people were pretty much forced to join the system when it changed.

# Do you have any other observations or thoughts about this questionnaire or the topics discussed, that you would like to share?
Less crayfish around to catch, and restrictions on the permitted catch size which affects income.
