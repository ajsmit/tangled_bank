# Please add any notes or observations regarding any of the changes above. What do you think has caused these changes?
Wind direction: instances where the direction changed on the daily rather than the usual continuous blowing in one direction. This year was a great NW wind. 

Currents: We prefer stronger upwelling, in the last two years there hasn't been much upwelling or the required change in termrpature required for the fishing. 

Storms: More in the last 2 years than in the last 15 years. 

Quantity of fish: Determined by DFFE, we tend to meet our quotas but weather doesn't always allow us to. This is a very dynamics fisheries and very dependent on the weather patterns. 

Seals: Many problems with seals. With penguins, they want to close off a large area of sea bvecause they think the penguins will die out even though the pelagic fish are just swimming through. BirdLife doesn't want to listen to us. The problem is the seals, not the fishing. Seal population is out of control, there needs to be more culling, and the seals just eat all the fish and penguins. They affect the food chain.

# Please add any notes or observations regarding how any of the above impacts on your ability to earn an income.
Seasonal component is affected by the weather, but not the fixed component.

# If you think these changes are a problem - how should they be addressed / fixed and by whom?
Seal population control, they need to be culled. They are affecting the whole coastline. Fisheries is not the problem for the penguins, just a small part of it, we aren't the reason the penguins are dying. The penguin problem is due to habitat loss (island scraping), the rats on the islands that eat the eggs, and the huge seal colony near Dyer Island that isn't helping, the governement allowed penguin eggs to be harvested years ago,  and now it's our problem.. The biggest issue is that the government want to close down a 20 mile by 20 mile area (close it off from pelagic fishing) to save the penguins, but this would impact the business and take away so many jobs, even though this is not the reaosn the penguins are dying.

# Do you have any other observations or thoughts about this questionnaire or the topics discussed, that you would like to share?
We are the largest creator of jobs in the area, but tourism has picked up in the 20 years so the economy is also incorpoating that. HUge iflux of retired people after the 94 government change as well, creatig businesses and ways forwards. So the town has grown. The whole town has changed, and we were once the lifeline of the town, but now the town is not as reliant due to economic growth. We put a few millions back into the community as well. 350-400k a year on socual payments towards schools. We contribute a lot to the local economy.
