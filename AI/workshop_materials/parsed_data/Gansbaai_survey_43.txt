With north wind - water warms up. With south wind - water cools down. Finding less fish inshore.

# What limits or constrains your income here ‚Äì how could you earn more? Please explain
Working for other people means you get less % profit per catch. Owns his own boat - huge expenses that go with owning a boat. Wear and tear expenses. Paying R8000 per day on petrol because fish are found further offshore. The fish moving offshore are now getting caught as bycatch by the trawlers - the trawlers have changed trawling habits and are now in conflict with line fishermen. Trawlers not being regulated and can operate day and night as they are very well resourced. The trawlers being in one place day and night are causing the fish to move and the line fishermen draw the short straw. Trawlers are changing their target fish so they can make their quotas and they are coming inshore even if their licenses dont allow them too. The trawlers being able to process fish on the ship itself - floating factory which catches all the fish that the local fisherman need

# Please add any notes or observations regarding any of the changes above. What do you think has caused these changes?
Bad wind has capsized boats - people have died. Because of SAMSA, working condition standards have increased too - fishing has become better regulated. Most wind is S/SW. Except in winter when it comes form the north. Cold water (<12degC) and fish wont bite. Terrible red tide a couple of years ago that caused a walkout of crayfish. Inshore there is some industrial pollution impacts from the factories. More seals now than before - they chase the fishing boats. Less fish now than before. Concerns about how the ships sheltering in the bay are polluting the bay.

# Please add any notes or observations regarding how any of the above impacts on your ability to earn an income.
Strong currents makes it harder to catch fish.

# If you think these changes are a problem - how should they be addressed / fixed and by whom?
Better regulations of the industrial fleets - the trawlers. The government should do this. The government is making decisions that the fishermen do not understand. The co-op application system is unfair (run by the government) - people who are deserving (eg local, traditional fisherman) do not get approval to join the co-op and get fishing permits. Lots of co-operative administrative corruption. Co-op should allow more safety and security but this is not the case - have to pay money to apply for separate permits for different species. Nothing has changed and the system is flawed. Government are cutting the amount of catch per individual. Get rid of the middle man to improve the co-operatives.

# Do you have any other observations or thoughts about this questionnaire or the topics discussed, that you would like to share?
