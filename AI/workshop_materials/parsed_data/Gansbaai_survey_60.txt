5

# Please explain your answer above.
Because we were an informal sector, our major income was derived from tourism. So tourists used to flock here to buy crayfish from us. But with the regulatory system, selling to tourists is now criminalized. We are required to sell to the co-op, they have taken away this source of livelihood..

# What worries you about the future in terms of the weather or climate in this location? Please explain.
Yes, climate change is very visible here. We have more bad weather days than we used to. And in summer when there is supposed to be good weather, it's getting windier than it ever was. This prevents us from fishing as much as we did.

# What limits or constrains your income here ‚Äì how could you earn more? Please explain
Our co-op works because we have the right leadership and the right management, and because we have forced the community to have a mindset shift from interim relief to long term security as possible through the co-op. The only problem is that DFFE is not giving us the rights for certain inshore species that were promised to us - DFFE is protecting the one commercial holder that has access to the economically viable resources (bull kelp, abalone, hake etc.) And then we could be in a position to become economically sustainable faster. So it‚Äôs not that the co-op model is failing, it is more the lack of commitment from DFFE, the lack of access to economically viable species. DFFE is still protecting the wealthy (the commercial sector), giving them the bulk of the quotas. We are merely getting the crumbs, Oceana gets 90 tons and maybe they employ about a 100 people across the West Coast. We have 134 people in the co-op and have to feed 134 families in Paternoster with a 3.2 ton quota of crayfish. This generates about 25k a year per family as formal income. The elitist system from the apartheid times has not left us. 

Access to ocean resources - we can't benefit off of pelagic species as they move around and we cannot get to them. Legally, 6 people are meant to fish white mussels, and they are meant to support the 134 people in the co-op in this particular resource. Legally, the system does not allow the co-op to benefit. Each species/resource has a different set of restrictions, and further restricts our ability to generate income. 

Shortening of the crayfish season (3 months) to prevent overharvesting. But because of the changing weather, this is not enough time to earn an income. Rather, they should have had more people policing on the landings to prevent overharvesting, They have made us the custodians of the resource but we don't have the resources to do this. 

No thought has gone into allocating small-scale fisher permits and allocation quotas. It has become a checkbox item. The size of our boats, catch etc is not taken into consideration. The permits are allocated based on area which makes no sense, unlike any other countries. 



# What are the other things do you worry about in this location that can affect your income?


# Unnamed: 21


# How do you fish?
Small scale motor boat

# What type of fish (species) do you target / handle?
Line fish (snoek, yellowtail, steentjies, roman etc)?, Lobster/crayfish?

# What type of gear do you use?
Handline, Hoop nets

# What do you do with your catch?
Eat some and sell some, Larger percentage goes to co-op to generate income

# Maak jy jou vangs skoon en verwerk jy dit?
Yes, I have it cleaned in a factory or by other staff, Yes, I clean it on shore, Fry system - generational system. The person assisting me with cleaning, prociessing and marketing my catch also get a small percentage to keep. This is an interpersonal system where the arrangement is agreed upon verbally. Our forefathers worked this way.

# As die vangs skoongemaak of verwerk is, hoe doen jy dit?
Vlek it and eat/use/sell it fresh, Land, clean, and sell on the same day

# Do your fishing habits or decisions depend on the what kind  of season you experience (e.g. windier, colder water etc,?).
5

# Please explain your answer above
For instance, no point fishing for crayfish with an SE wind. Snoek is caught in NW wind and weather.

# Please add any notes or observations regarding any of the changes above. What do you think has caused these changes?
Unseasonal winds in the summer. The windy season has now extended from October to December and is much longer than before. 

Storms are now coming from the South West, this never happened before. Stormy weather would always come from the NW.

Water temp is colder - fish are less active. 

Red tide: in the past, they'd last about 3-4 days, Now they last weeks. More prevalent and longer lasting. 

Pollution: two instances of cargo ships polluting with phosphate dumping. Not a common occurence, but slightly more common off late. 

Fish distribution has changes, not necessarily new species. Snoek patterns have changed. We used to catch them in the winter, now we find them in the summer as well. 

Seal and penguins: populations are declining, you can see that the colonies are less dense than before.

# If you think these changes are a problem - how should they be addressed / fixed and by whom?
DFFE needs to wake up and get their shit together. If they were to have a better form of communication and listen to communities, listen to our local knowledge that they don't have, then the resource could have been managed so much better. We know the areas, we've done the research, they won't use our knowledge and expertise. In my mind, the research they use is incorrect and leads to complete mismanagement of the resource.

# Do you have any other observations or thoughts about this questionnaire or the topics discussed, that you would like to share?
My personal opinion is that the SSF legislation should not be a separate entity .The law should apply to everyone equally and everyone should have equal access to natural resources. The MLRA should be reviewed and re-written with the inclusion of local and indigenous knowledge and expertise, which hasn't happened. They're still using the same MLRA from when it was formed in the apartheid government and "dictated" to us, and does not reflect the true state of the resources here. Inacceesible and oppressive system that didn't move with the times or demands. Government is responsible to create sustainable jobs, but they are allowing the commerical sector to dictate who works, when they work, and how much they get paid. This is just unsustainable, and cannot get rid of poverty.
