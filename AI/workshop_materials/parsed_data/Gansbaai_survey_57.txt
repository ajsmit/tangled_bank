# Please add any notes or observations regarding any of the changes above. What do you think has caused these changes?
Water temp change in summer is warmer and is not possible to farm when it leaves the threshold of around 12/13 degrees as it increases to around 17 degrees. Red tide isn't too bad right here in Paternoster but if it is bad even further down the coast such as in elandsbaai, they must still follow regulations and are unable to export. Lots more plastic from tourists walking on the beach. Crayfish yields have decreased over the years.
