# Please add any notes or observations regarding any of the changes above. What do you think has caused these changes?
2019 and 2024 have been the worst years. "Skrikkel" year is always bad. Heavy storms, high tides. In 2015, there was a bad red tide. Lots of dead seals washed up on the beach.  Less fish than before. There are more crayfish now, but this is probably because people have not been taking their whole quota out.

# If you think these changes are a problem - how should they be addressed / fixed and by whom?
The government should help us. We need our people to be trained (capacity building), and the provision of equipment. Training for skippers would be very useful. People can drive boats but they don't have licenses that allow them to do so, so if we coulf get those training and licenses for the co-op.

# Do you have any other observations or thoughts about this questionnaire or the topics discussed, that you would like to share?
We would also like some to be sponsored to have the town cleaned up - lots of plastic everywhere. If someone could pay the youth to pick up thiese things and clean up the town and coast.
