## Introduction

This study is about air quality.

## Methods

### Data

The dataset used in this study is the `airquality` dataset from R, which contains daily air quality measurements in New York from May to September 1973. The dataset includes variables such as ozone levels, solar radiation, wind speed, and temperature.

### Analysis

The R script in the code chunk further explores the impact of temperature on ozone level. All analyses were done in R [@R2025].

```{r}
#| label: fig-airquality
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-cap-location: bottom
#| fig-cap: "Temperature and ozone level."
#| warning: false

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess")
```

## Results

The results show that air has quality (@fig-airquality).
