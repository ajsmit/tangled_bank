  <Question>
    A seabird follows the seasons by instinct; a human follows them with satellites, spreadsheets, and climate models. Does our reliance on abstract representations of nature, which no other animal has ever conceived, give us a deeper mastery over it or merely a more profound illusion of control?
  </Question>


  <Context>
    The module frames biodiversity and biogeography as pattern–process inference across environmental gradients, with observation spanning field sampling and Earth-observation time series. Remote sensing and computational modelling extend inference across scales and into scenario space, while gradients link measurable drivers to ecological structure and function, detectable via satellite products and derived environmental distances. High β-diversity and distance-decay patterns provide one bridge from representation to explanation, and unimodal species–environment responses justify turnover along gradients. The biodiversity partitions α, β, γ remain tools—not ends—and must be integrated with argument rather than recited. Mixed in with the module should be the student's personal insights about humanity, human nature, and the relationship between humans and nature. Also, the student should be encouraged to use the module to develop their own insights about the relationship between humans and nature.

  <Criteria>
    <Criterion id="PHIL" name="Philosophical architecture and stance">
      <Description>
        Clarity and ambition of the thesis; depth of analysis of representation, truth, control, uncertainty, scale, and causation; ability to develop a dialectic (mastery vs illusion) without straw-person claims; command of concepts such as model–world isomorphism, predictive adequacy vs ontic truth, and limits of measurement. A significant part of the essay should be dedicated to the student's personal insights about humanity, human nature, and the relationship between humans and nature. Less empasis on the course concepts.
      </Description>
      <Levels>
        <Level band="A+" range="90-100">
          A defensible, original thesis (e.g., "mastery vs illusion" -- choose a side and defend it) sustained through rigorous argument that treats models and measurements as epistemic instruments with articulated limits; integrates counter-positions and resolves them with clean reasoning; shows command of how abstraction can both reveal process and fabricate artefacts; finishes with implications for practice (management, forecasting) rather than aphorisms.
        </Level>
        <Level band="A" range="80-89">
          Clear thesis with sustained reasoning; engages with at least one counter-argument; analyses representation–reality slippage and decision-making consequences; minor gaps in precision or scope.
        </Level>
        <Level band="B" range="70-79">
          Coherent position with some analytic depth; gestures to uncertainty and scale but leaves key claims unexamined or asserted; counter-argument noted but weakly handled.
        </Level>
        <Level band="C" range="60-69">
          Descriptive, dichotomous, ambiguous, or weak treatment (of mastery vs illusion) with limited analysis; reliance on slogans or generic risk/benefit lists; minimal engagement with epistemic limits.
        </Level>
        <Level band="D/F" range="0-59">
          Thesis unclear or internally inconsistent; no conclusion w.r.t. the thesis; category errors (e.g., model validation equated with truth), or casual relativism with no argumentative work.
        </Level>
      </Levels>
    </Criterion>


<Criterion id="INTEG" name="Integration with BDC334 ecological concepts or with personal knowledge about humans/humanity">
  <Description>
    Uses course concepts to advance the philosophical argument rather than to decorate it: e.g., gradients, distance-decay, unimodal responses, α/β/γ partitioning, dissimilarity vs distance matrices, environmental standardisation, and links to observation and modelling (but not limited to these alone). Alternatively, may take approach to assess if/how technology define our relationship with biodiversity concepts, or what human nature brings into the mix.
  </Description>
  <AlignmentNotes>
    For example, species and environmental tables, matrices of distances and dissimilarities, distance-decay and β-diversity as evidence for structured turnover; unimodal species responses for mechanism; environmental distance and standardisation for comparability and inference... are these the only insights humans can have or do we have access to something more?
  </AlignmentNotes>
  <Levels>
    <Level band="A+" range="90-100">
      Course concepts is creatively woven into the argument: e.g., shows how satellite-derived gradients (standardised) feed environmental distance matrices and then predict β-turnover via unimodal responses; contrasts predictive performance with overfitting/artefacts; uses α/β/γ only where they move the thesis.
    </Level>
    <Level band="A" range="80-89">
      Accurate deployment of multiple course elements (gradients, β-metrics, distance vs dissimilarity) with clear linkage to the essay’s stance; minimal formula-dropping.
    </Level>
    <Level band="B" range="70-79">
      Correct concepts, partly instrumentalised; occasional definition-listing without argumentative work.
    </Level>
    <Level band="C" range="60-69">
      Patchy correctness; concepts appear as disconnected facts; α/β/γ recited; weak or missing link from data structures to the claim about mastery/illusion.
    </Level>
    <Level band="D/F" range="0-59">
      Misuse of core ideas (e.g., Euclidean distance on species matrices; no standardisation before environmental distances; β confused with richness).
    </Level>
  </Levels>
</Criterion>

<Criterion id="EVID" name="Use of examples, evidence, and mechanism">
  <Description>
    Possible use of concrete ecological or data-analytic illustrations (e.g., coastline gradients, elevation, fire regimes, seaweed dataset, Doubs River, and others); explanation of how evidence bears on the thesis (support, limitation, falsification); insights about human nature and humans' relationship with knowledge. Demonstrate knowledge and thinking beyond ecological and data-analytical thinking.
  </Description>
  <Levels>
    <Level band="A+" range="90-100">
      Deploys at least one well-chosen examples (e.g., coastal temperature gradient and elevation turnover) to show how abstractions (e.g., satellite SST, Euclidean environmental distance) predict β and where they might fail; comments on sampling effort or rarefaction when adjudicating claims. Or discuss human progress in the light of knowledge development and transmission. Or any other biological/socio-ecological/geographic/historical claims that support their argument.
    </Level>
