## Instructions

- Please answer all questions in a properly titled and structured MS Word document.
- Marks are indicative of the amount of time you should allocate to the task, rather that an indication of "marks to facts" assignment.
- [TOTAL MARKS: 55]{.my-highlight}
- [TOTAL TIME: 120 minutes]{.my-highlight}

## Question 1 (20 Marks)

You are an alien super-intelligence travelling across the universe to attend the *Intergalactic Conference on Lesser Intelligent Life*. On your way, you discover a previously unknown planet: Earth. 

Using your advanced instruments, you quickly survey the planet’s life and find two dominant life forms:

1.	A bipedal, carbon-based organism that manipulates its environment extensively.
2.	A widespread, silicon-based intelligence that also seems to shape the planet.

Many other carbon-based organisms exist, but they appear strongly influenced by the activities of the carbon-based species.

As a galactic ecologist, design a study to investigate the drivers of the spatial distribution of these two dominant life forms. In your answer, address:

- What environmental and ecological factors might explain their distributions and uneasy coexistence?
- How you would measure and analyse these drivers (*e.g.*, gradients, biogeographic breaks, diversity metrics, environmental distance).
- The likely impacts of these dominant life forms on less dominant species.
- The major findings you would expect from your study.

Draw on ecological theory, biodiversity metrics, and human impact frameworks in your response.

<!-- ## Question 2 (15 marks) -->

<!-- Provide a short explanation, with examples, for what is meant by this statement: -->

<!-- > “Communities often seem to display very strong structural graduation relative to ‘variables’ such as altitude, latitude, and depth; however, these variables are not the actual drivers of the processes that structure communities.” -->

## Question 2 (25 Marks)

It is the year 2034. After years of campaigning, the South African Green Party has become a strong political force, positioning itself as the official opposition to the ruling party.

As leader of the Green Party, write an opinion piece outlining the ecological solutions your party proposes for South Africa. Your argument should show how ecological thinking can help address both environmental challenges (*e.g.*, biodiversity loss, climate change, ecosystem degradation) and socio-economic issues (*e.g.*, inequality, unemployment, food and water security) facing South Africans in the 2030s.

In your answer, integrate ecological theory, biodiversity concepts, and examples from South Africa and globally.

**Note:** Avoid vague or generic statements such as "plant trees", "educate people", or "develop policies". Ensure the socio-economic connection is covered, and show a clear links to ecological theory such as IPBES concepts.  

## Question 3 (10 Marks)

Write a short reflective essay (no more than 0.5 of a page) on the most transformative insight you have gained during your studies at UWC. This could be from BDC334 or from another course, fieldwork, lab work, or independent study.

In your essay, address:

- What specific idea, skill, or experience changed how you think about science or the world?
- Why did this insight matter to you personally or intellectually?
- How did it challenge or overturn any preconceptions you once held?
- How has it influenced the way you now approach questions as a developing scientist?

Avoid clichés (*e.g.*, "as a biologist, I have come to learn that all of nature is connected") or broad generalisations. Be precise, honest, and reflective.
