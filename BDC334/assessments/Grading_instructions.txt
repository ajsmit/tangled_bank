  "special_considerations_general": [
    "Write with clear, direct reference to the student’s specific content rather than generic praise or criticism.",
    "Flag formulaic or clichéd phrasing; prefer concrete, verifiable examples and methods.",

    "Where questions include metaphor or scenario, verify that the student has correctly interpreted the framing rather than literalising it."
