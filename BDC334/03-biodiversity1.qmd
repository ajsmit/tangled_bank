The IUCN definition considers a diversity of diversity concepts. This module looks at diversity only at the species level (species diversity). However, we can also approach macroecological problems from phylogenetic and functional (and other) diversity concepts of view. Functional and phylogenetic diversity ideas will be introduced in the [BDC743 module Quantitative Ecology](../BCB743/BCB743_index.qmd).

# Preparation

## The South African seaweed data

In these examples, we will use the seaweed data of @smit2017seaweeds.
Please make sure that you read this paper. An additional file describing the background to the data is available [here](../docs/Smit_the_seaweed_data.pdf) (@fig-seaweed-sections).

![The coastal sections and associated seawater temperature profile associated with the study by @smit2017seaweeds.](../images/Seaweed_sections.png){#fig-seaweed-sections fig-align="center"}

One of the datasets, $Y$ (in the file `SeaweedSpp.csv`),
comprises updated distribution records of 847 macroalgal species within each of 58 × 50 km-long sections of the South African coast [@bolton2002seaweed]. The dataset captures *ca*. 90% of the known seaweed flora of South Africa, but excludes some very small and/or very rare species for which data are insufficient. The data are from verifiable literature sources and John Bolton and Rob Anderson's collections, assembled from information collected by teams of phycologists over three decades [@bolton1986marine; @stegenga1997seaweeds; @bolton2002seaweed; @de2005guide]. Another file, $E$ (in `env.csv`), is a dataset of *in situ* coastal seawater temperatures derived from daily
measurements over 40 years [@smit2013coastal].

## Setting up the analysis environment

We will use **R**, so first, we must find, install and load various packages. Some packages will be available on CRAN and can be accessed and installed the usual way, but you will need to download others from [R Forge](https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=195).

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(vegan)
library(betapart)
library(BiodiversityR) # this package may at times be problematic to install
```

## A look at the data

Let's load the data and see how it is structured:

```{r}
spp <- read.csv('../data/seaweed/SeaweedSpp.csv')
spp <- dplyr::select(spp, -1)

# Lets look at the data:
dim(spp)
```

We see that our dataset has 58 rows and 847 columns. What is in the
columns and rows? Start with the first five rows and five columns:

```{r}
spp[1:5, 1:5]
```

Now the last five rows and five columns:

```{r}
spp[(nrow(spp) - 5):nrow(spp), (ncol(spp) - 5):ncol(spp)]
```

So, each row corresponds to a site (i.e. each of the coastal sections), and each column contains a species. We arrange the species alphabetically and use a six-letter code to identify them.

# Species data

When ecologists talk about species diversity, they typically consider the characteristics of biological communities in a specific habitat, ecological community, or ecosystem. Species diversity considers three essential concepts about how species are distributed in space: their **richness**, **abundance**, and **evenness**. We can express each of these as biodiversity metrics that allow us to compare communities in space and time.

When ecologists talk about 'biodiversity', they might not necessarily be
interested in *all* the plants and animals and things that are neither
plant nor animal that occur at a particular place. Some ecologists are
interested in ants and moths. Others might find fish more insightful.
Some even like marine mammals! I prefer seaweed. The analysis of
biodiversity data might often be constrained to some higher-level taxon,
such as all angiosperms in a landscape, reptiles, etc. (but we sample all
species in the higher-level taxon). Some ecological
questions benefit from comparisons of diversity assessments among
selected taxa (avifauna vs small mammals, for example), as this focus
might address some particular ecological hypothesis. The bird vs small
mammal comparison might reveal how barriers such as
streams and rivers structure biodiversity patterns. In our examples, we
will use such focused datasets.

Here we look at the various measures of biodiversity, viz. $\alpha$-, $\gamma$- and $\beta$-diversity. David Zelený, in his [Analysis of community data in R](https://www.davidzeleny.net/anadat-r/doku.php/en:diversity_analysis), provides deeper analysis and compulsory reading. 

<!--- # Topic 2: Measures of biodiversity --->

# Three measures of biodiversity: $\alpha$-, $\gamma$-, $\beta$-diversity

@whittaker1972evolution coined three measures of biodiversity, and the concepts were ‘modernised’ by @jurasinski2009inventory. The concepts
represent the measurement of biodiversity *across different spatial
scales*. $\alpha$- and $\gamma$-diversity express the total number of species in an area. The first, $\alpha$-diversity, represents the number of species at the small (local) scale, such as, for example, within a sampling unit like a quadrat, transect, plot, or trawl. Alternatively, maybe the research question represents the local scale by several sampling units nesting within a small patch of landscape and defines the mean species richness within this patch as local. Multiples (sampling units or patches) are nested within a larger region (or ecosystem) and serve as replicates. The complete number of species across all of these replicates indicates the diversity at a larger scale---this is called $\gamma$-diversity. $\beta$-diversity refers to the change in species composition among samples (sites).

By now, you will have received a brief [Introduction to
R](02a-r_rstudio.qmd), and we can proceed with looking at
some of the measures of biodiversity. We will start by using data on the
seaweeds of South Africa to demonstrate some ideas around diversity
measures. The **vegan**^[I am by no means an advocate for veganism.] (for *vegetation analysis*) package [@oksanen2022vegan] offers [various
functions](../docs/Oksanen_diversity-vegan.pdf) to calculate diversity
indices. I will demonstrate some of these functions below.

## Alpha diversity

We can represent $\alpha$-diversity in three ways:

1. as *species richness*, $S$;

2. as a *univariate diversity index*, such as the $\alpha$ parameter of [Fisher’s log-series](04-biodiversity.html#species-abundance-distribution), Shannon diversity, $H'$, Simpson’s diversity, $\lambda$; or
    
3. Species *evenness*, e.g. Pielou’s evenness, $J$.

We will work through each in turn.

### Species richness, $S$

First, is species richness, which we denote by the symbol $S$. This is the simplest measure of alpha-diversity, counting the number of species (or other taxonomic level) present in a given community or sample. It doesn't consider the abundance of species.

In the seaweed biodiversity data---because we view each coastal section as the local scale (the smallest unit of sampling)---I count the number of species within each of the sections.

The preferred option for calculating species richness is the
`specnumber()` function in **vegan**:

```{r}
specnumber(spp, MARGIN = 1)
```

The data output is easier to understand if we display it as a `tibble()`:

```{r}
# Use 'MARGIN = 1' to calculate the number of species within each row (site)
spp_richness <- tibble(section = 1:58,
                       richness = specnumber(spp, MARGIN = 1))
head(spp_richness)
```

The `diversityresult()` function in the **BiodiversityR** package can do
the same (sometimes this package is difficult to install due to various
software dependencies that might be required for the package to load
properly--- do not be sad if this method does not work):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
spp_richness <- diversityresult(spp, index = 'richness',
                                method = 'each site')
# spp_richness
```

Now we make a plot seen in @fig-species-richness:

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "The seaweed species richness, $S$, within each of the coastal sections along the shore of South Africa."
#| label: fig-species-richness
ggplot(data = spp_richness, (aes(x = 1:58, y = richness))) +
  geom_line(size = 1.2, colour = "indianred") +
  xlab("Coastal section, west to east") +
  ylab("Species richness") +
  theme_linedraw()
```

In other instances, it makes more sense to calculate the mean species
richness of all the sampling units (e.g. quadrats) taken inside the
ecosystem of interest. You will have to decide based on your data.

The mean species richness is:

```{r}
round(mean(spp_richness$richness), 0)
```

### Univariate diversity indices

The second way we can express $\alpha$-diversity is to use one of the univariate diversity indices. The choice of which indices to use should be informed by the extent to which one wants to emphasise richness or evenness. Species
richness, $S$, does not consider evenness as it is all about richness (obviously). Simpson's $\lambda$ emphasises evenness a lot more. Shannon's $H'$ is somewhere in the middle.

**Simpson's $\lambda$**, or simply the Simpson index, is a measure that represents the probability that two individuals randomly selected from a sample will belong to the same species. It is calculated as:

$$\displaystyle \lambda = \sum_{i=1}^{S} p_{i}^{2}$$ where $S$ is the
species richness and $p_{i}$ is the relative abundance of the $i$th
species.

**Shannon's $H'$** is sometimes called Shannon's diversity, the Shannon-Wiener index, the Shannon-Weaver index, or the Shannon entropy. This is a more nuanced measure that considers both species richness and evenness (how evenly individuals are distributed across different species).

It is calculated as:

$$H' = -\sum_{i=1}^{S} p_{i} \ln p_{i}$$ where $p_{i}$ is the proportion of individuals belonging to the $i$th species, and $S$ is the species richness.

**Fisher's $\alpha$** estimates the $\alpha$ parameter of [Fisher's logarithmic series](03-04-biodiversity.html#species-abundance-distribution) (see functions `fisher.alpha()` and `fisherfit()`). The estimation is possible only for actual counts (i.e. integers) of individuals, so it will not work for per cent cover, biomass, and other measures that real numbers can express. It's especially useful for comparing the diversity of samples with different total abundances. We will get to this function later under [Fisher's logarithmic series](03-04-biodiversity.html#species-abundance-distribution).

Except for Fisher's-$\alpha$, we cannot calculate these for the seaweed data because, in order to do so, we require abundance data---the seaweed data are presence-absence only. Let us load a fictitious dataset of the diversity of three different communities of plants, with each community corresponding to a different light environment (dim, mid, and high light):

```{r}
light <- read.csv("../data/light_levels.csv")
light
```

We can see above that instead of having data with 1s and 0s for presence-absence, here we have some values that indicate the relative amounts of each of the species in the three light environments. We calculate species richness (as before), and also the Shannon and Simpson indices using **vegan**'s `diversity()` function:

```{r}
light_div <- tibble(
  site = c("low_light", "mid_light", "high_light"),
  richness = specnumber(light[, 2:7], MARGIN = 1),
  shannon = round(diversity(light[, 2:7], MARGIN = 1, index = "shannon"), 2),
  simpson = round(diversity(light[, 2:7], MARGIN = 1, index = "simpson"), 2)
)
light_div
```

<!-- Hill numbers, $q$, (Hill, 1973) summarise $S$, Shannon's $H'$ and Simpson's $\lambda$. Higher $q$ puts less weight on rare species and weighs abundant ones more. Hill numbers can be used to draw diversity profiles, which allow for an elegant comparison of diversity among communities considering both richness and evenness. -->

<!-- ```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=5} -->

<!-- data(BCI) -->

<!-- i <- sample(nrow(BCI), 12) -->

<!-- mod <- renyi(BCI[i,]) -->

<!-- plot(mod) -->

<!-- mod <- renyiaccum(BCI[i,]) -->

<!-- plot(mod, as.table=TRUE, col = c(1, 2, 2)) -->

<!-- persp(mod) -->

<!-- ``` -->

Evenness refers to the shape of a [species abundance distribution](04-biodiversity.html#species-abundance-distribution), which suggests the relative abundance of different species.

One index for evenness is Pielou's evenness, $J$:

$$J = \frac{H^{\prime}} {log(S)}$$

where $H'$ is Shannon's diversity index, and $S$ the number of species
(i.e. $S$).

To calculate Pielou's evenness index for the `light` data, we can do
this:

```{r}
H <- diversity(light[, 2:7], MARGIN = 1, index = "shannon")

J <- H/log(specnumber(light[, 2:7]))
round(J, 2)
```

**Berger-Parker Index** indicates the proportion of the community that the most abundant species represents. It is given by the formula: 

$$d = \frac{N_{max}}{N}$$
where $N_{max}$ is the number of individuals of the most common species and $N$ is the total number of individuals in the sample.

**Chao1 and ACE** are estimators often used to predict the total species richness in a community based on the number of rare species observed in samples.

## Gamma diversity

Staying with the seaweed data, $Y$, let us now look at $\gamma$-diversity---this would be the total number of species along the South African coastline in all 58 coastal sections. Since each column represents one species, and the dataset contains data collected at each of the 58 sites (the number of rows), we can do:

```{r}
# the number of columns gives the total number of species in this example:
ncol(spp)
```

We can also use:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
diversityresult(spp, index = 'richness', method = 'pooled')
```

<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- specpool() -->

<!-- ``` -->

:::

Think before you calculate $\gamma$-diversity for your own data as it might not be as simple as here!

## Beta-diversity

### Whittaker's concept of $\beta$-diversity

The first measure of $\beta$-diversity comes from @whittaker1960vegetation and is called *true $\beta$-diversity*. In this instance, divide the $\gamma$-diversity for the region by the $\alpha$-diversity for a specific coastal section. We can calculate it all at once for the whole dataset and make a graph (@fig-true-beta):

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Whittaker’s true β-diversity shown in the seaweed data."
#| label: fig-true-beta
true_beta <- data.frame(
  beta = specnumber(spp, MARGIN = 1) / ncol(spp),
  section_no = c(1:58)
)
# true_beta
ggplot(data = true_beta, (aes(x = section_no, y = beta))) +
  geom_line(size = 1.2, colour = "indianred") +
  xlab("Coastal section, west to east") +
  ylab("True beta-diversity") +
  theme_linedraw()
```

The second measure of $\beta$-diversity is *absolute species turnover*, and to calculate this, we subtract $\alpha$-diversity for each  section from the region's $\gamma$-diversity (@fig-abs-beta):

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Whittaker’s absolute species turnover shown in action in the seaweed data."
#| label: fig-abs-beta
abs_beta <- data.frame(
  beta = ncol(spp) - specnumber(spp, MARGIN = 1),
  section_no = c(1:58)
)
# abs_beta
ggplot(data = abs_beta, (aes(x = section_no, y = beta))) +
  geom_line(size = 1.2, colour = "indianred") +
  xlab("Coastal section, west to east") +
  ylab("Absolute beta-diversity") +
  theme_linedraw()
```

### Contemporary definitions $\beta$-diversity

Contemporary definitions of $\beta$-diversity rely on pairwise *dissimilarity indices* such as Bray-Curtis, Jaccard, or Sørensen dissimilarities---see @koleff2003measuring for many more; also see `?vegdist`. However, discussing pairwise dissimilarities with $\beta$-diversity makes more sense.

#### Dissimilarity indices

In this Section, we will cover the dissimilarity indices, special cases of diversity indices that use pairwise comparisons between sampling units, habitats, or ecosystems.

Species dissimilarities result in pairwise matrices similar to the pairwise correlation or Euclidian distance matrices we have seen in [Lab 1](01-introduction.qmd). In [Lab 2b](02b-env_dist.qmd) you will have also learned how to calculate these ecological distances in R. These dissimilarity indices are multivariate and compare between sites, sections, plots, etc., and must therefore not be confused with the univariate diversity indices.

We use the Bray-Curtis and Jaccard indices with abundance data and the Sørensen dissimilarity with presence-absence data. The seaweed dataset is a presence-absence dataset that necessitates using the Sørensen index. The interpretation of the resulting square (number of rows = number of columns) dissimilarity matrices is the same regardless of whether we calculate it for an abundance or presence-absence dataset. The values in the matrix range from 0 to 1. A 0 means that the pair of sites we compare is identical (all species in common) but 1 means they are completely different (no species in common). In the square dissimilarity matrix, the diagonal is 0, which essentially (and obviously) means that any site is identical to itself. Elsewhere the values will range from 0 to 1. Since this is a pairwise calculation (each site compared to every other site), our seaweed dataset will contain (58 × (58 - 1))/2 = 1653 values, each one ranging from 0 to 1.

The first step involves the species table, $Y$. First, we compute the Sørensen dissimilarity index, $\beta_{\text{sør}}$, to compare the dissimilarity of all pairs of coastal sections using presence-absence data. The dissimilarity in species composition between two sections is calculated from three parameters, *viz*., *b* and *c*, which represent the number of species unique to each of the two sites, and *a*, the number of species in common between them. It is given by:

$$\beta_\text{sør}=\frac{b+c}{2a+b+c}$$

The **vegan** function `vegdist()` provides access to the dissimilarity indices. We calculate the Sørensen dissimilarity index:

```{r}
sor <- vegdist(spp, binary = TRUE) # makes the lower triangle matrix
sor_df <- round(as.matrix(sor), 4)
dim(sor_df)
sor_df[1:10, 1:10] # the first 10 rows and columns
```

What we see above is a square dissimilarity matrix. The most important characteristics of the matrix are:

i.  whereas the raw species data, $Y$, is rectangular (number rows ≠ number columns), the dissimilarity matrix is square (number rows = number columns);

ii. the diagonal is filled with 0;

iii. the matrix is symmetrical---it is comprised of symetrical upper and lower triangles.

Create a data.frame suitable for plotting:
```{r}
sor_df <- data.frame(round(as.matrix(sor), 4))
```

## Lab 3
(To be reviewed by BCB743 student but not for marks)

These questions concern matrices produced from species data using any of the indices available in `vegdist()`:

1. Why is the matrix square, and what determines the
number of rows/columns?

2. What is the meaning of the diagonal?

3. What is the meaning of the non-diagonal elements?

4. Referring to the seaweed species data specifically, take the data in row 1 or column 1 and create a line graph showing these values as a function of the section number.

:::

Dissimilarity indices will be unpacked in more detail under [contemporary views of $\beta$-diversity](03-04-biodiversity.html#contemporary-definitions-beta-diversity).

#### Species turnover and nestedness-resultant $\beta$-diversity

Contemporary views of $\beta$-diversity are available by @nekola1999distance, @baselga2010partitioning, and @anderson2011navigating---this information is encapsulated with matrices of dissimilarity indices. Nowadays, we see $\beta$-diversity is a concept that describes how species assemblages (communities) measured within the ecosystem of interest vary from place to place, e.g. between the various transects or quadrats used to sample the ecosystem. $\beta$-diversity results from habitat heterogeneity (along gradients or randomly). We have already seen two concepts of $\beta$-diversity, viz. true $\beta$-diversity and absolute species turnover---both rely on knowledge of species richness at local (a measure of $\alpha$-diversity) and regional ($\gamma$-diversity) scales. However, more insight into **species assembly processes** can be extracted when we view $\beta$-diversity as a dissimilarity index. In this view, we will see that there are *two processes* by which $\beta$-diversity might be affected (i.e. in which the patterning of communities over landscapes might arise). These offer glimpses into mechanistic influences on how ecosystems are structured.

**Process 1:** If a region comprises the species A, B, C, ..., M
(i.e. $\gamma$-diversity is 13), a subset of the regional flora captured by one quadrat might be species **A**, **D**, E. In another quadrat species **A**, **D**, F might be present. $\alpha$-diversity is three in both instances, and heterogeneity (and hence $\beta$-diversity) results from the fact that the first quadrat has species E, but the other has species F. In other words, here, we have the same number of species in both quadrats, but only two of the species are the same. The process responsible for this form of $\beta$-diversity is species **turnover**, $\beta_\text{sim}$. Turnover refers to processes that cause communities to differ due to species being lost or gained from section to section, i.e. the species composition changes between sections without corresponding changes in $\alpha$-diversity. The  function `beta()` in the R package **BAT** calls this form of $\beta$ diversity **replacement** and use the symbol $\beta_{repl}$ (@cardoso2015bat).

**Process 2:** Consider again species A, B, C, ..., M. Now we have a quadrat with species **A**, **B**, C, D, **G**, H ($\alpha$-diversity is
six) but another quadrat has a subset of these species, e.g. only species **A**, **B**, **G** ($\alpha$-diversity three). Here, $\beta$-diversity is high even though the quadrats share *some* species, but the number of species differs among the quadrats (i.e. from place to place) due to one quadrat capturing only a subset of species present in the other. This
form of $\beta$-diversity is called **nestedness-resultant** $\beta$-diversity, $\beta_\text{sne}$, and it refers to processes that cause species to be gained or lost, and the community with the lowest $\alpha$-diversity is a subset of the richer community. The function `beta()` in the R package **BAT** calls this form of $\beta$ diversity *richness difference** and uses the symbol $\beta_{rich}$ (@cardoso2015bat).

The above two examples show that $\beta$-diversity is coupled not only with the identity of the species in the quadrats but also $\alpha$-diversity---with species richness in particular.

We express $\beta$-diversity as nestedness-resultant, $\beta_\text{sne}$, and turnover, $\beta_\text{sim}$, components to be able to distinguish between these two processes. It allows us to make inferences about the two possible drivers of $\beta$-diversity. Turnover refers to processes that cause communities to differ due to species being lost or gained from section to section, i.e. the species composition changes between sections without corresponding changes in $\alpha$-diversity. The nestedness-resultant component implies processes that cause species to be gained or lost without replacement, and the community with the lowest $\alpha$-diversity is a subset of the richer community.

According to @nekola1999distance on p. 868, there are *two causes* of ecological distance decay. 'Ecological' is key to the first cause---it is environmental filtering results in a decrease in similarity as the distance between sites increases. We sometimes call this the **niche difference model**. Such patterns are typically visible along steep environmental gradients such as elevation slopes (mountains), latitude, or depth in the ocean, to name only three. It is also the dominant mechanism underlying island biogeography.

The second cause of distance decay *sensu* @nekola1999distance involves aspects of the spatial configuration, context of the habitats, and some temporal considerations. Here, the evolutionary differences between species---specifically around those traits that affect their ability to disperse---are more at play and are the primary influences of distance decay rates that might vary between species. Let us first consider some properties of a hypothetical homogeneous landscape. The landscape creates some impediment (resistance) to the propagation of some species (hypothetically species A, B, and C) across its surface, but which are less effective in impeding others (D, E, and F). For argument's sake, all species (A, ..., F) share similar environmental tolerances to the prevailing environmental conditions, so one can argue that the niche difference model (environmental filtering) does not explain distributional patterns. Given a particular founding or disturbance event, species D, E, and F will, in a relatively shorter period, be able to become evenly distributed (relatively similar abundances everywhere) across this landscape. However, the less vagile (in terms of dispersal ability), species A, B, and C will develop a steeper gradient of decreasing species abundances away from the founding populations (resulting from, for example, adaptive radiation). They will require more time to become homogeneously dispersed across the landscape. In this regard, historical events set up striking distributional patterns that can be mistaken for gradients, which exist because insufficient time has passed to ensure complete dispersal. Studying the influence of such past events is called 'historical biogeography.' In reality, landscapes are seldom homogeneous in their spatial template (e.g. there are hills and valleys), and variable dispersal mechanisms and abilities will interact with this heterogeneous landscape to form interesting patterns of communities. The ecologist will have an exciting time figuring out the relative importance of actual gradients vs those that result from evolved traits that affect their dispersal ability and interact with the environment. I have not said anything about 'neutral theories' [but which are seen in the $\beta_\text{sne}$ form of $\beta$-diversity as in @smit2017seaweeds], nor biological interactions that might affect community structure.

How do we calculate the turnover and nestedness-resultant components of $\beta$-diversity? The **betapart** package [@baselga2022betapart] comes to the rescue. We decompose the dissimilarity into the $\beta_\text{sim}$ and $\beta_\text{sne}$ components [@baselga2010partitioning] using the `betapart.core()` and `betapart.pair()` functions. The outcomes of this partitioning calculation are placed into the matrices $Y1$ and $Y2$. These data can then be analysed further---e.g. we can apply a principal components analysis (PCA) or another multivariate analysis on $Y$ to find the major patterns in the community data---we will do this in a later section.

```{r}
# Decompose total Sørensen dissimilarity into turnover and nestedness-resultant
# components:
Y.core <- betapart.core(spp)
Y.pair <- beta.pair(Y.core, index.family = "sor")

# Let Y1 be the turnover component (beta-sim):
Y1 <- data.frame(round(as.matrix(Y.pair$beta.sim), 3))

# Let Y2 be the nestedness-resultant component (beta-sne):
Y2 <- data.frame(round(as.matrix(Y.pair$beta.sne), 3))
```

A portion of the turnover component matrix:
```{r}
Y1[1:10, 1:10]
```

A portion of the nestedness-resultant matrix:
```{r}
Y2[1:10, 1:10]
```

A portion of the nestedness-resultant matrix reformatted as a `tibble()`^[Note that the rows are no longer numbered in the tibble view, but it can easily be recreated by `seq(1:58)`.]:
```{r}
Y2_tib <- as_tibble(Y2)

-   `BDC334_<first_name>_<last_name>_Lab_3.R`

(the `<` and `>` must be omitted as they are used in the example as
field indicators only).

Submit your appropriately named R documents on iKamva when ready.

Failing to follow these instructions carefully, precisely, and
thoroughly will cause you to lose marks, which could cause a significant
drop in your score as formatting counts for 15% of the final mark (out
of 100%).
